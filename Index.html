            <h2>THE CIRCUS MAGAZINE</h2>
            <p>brief into as in the footer</p>
		<p>The Circus Magazine is a project developed for the final exam of <a href="https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2021/454464">Information Modelling and Web Technologies</a> course within the <a href="https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge">DHDK Master's Degree</a>, Alma Mater Studiorum - Università di Bologna, a.y. 2020/2021.</p>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<p>The project started with a team call to establish the steps and having a first brainstorming on the Journal topic core.</p>
		<p>After a brief discussion, we went for a wide reference to the “Circus” because it is a suitable topic to be seen by several points of view (historical, social, medical, animal welfare related, artistic representations, and so on) as well as suitable to be treated in different visual layouts.</p>
		<p>Then we started to search the 9 articles (3 each of the three issues) strongly related within the same issue and at least quite related between the issues.</p>
		<p>In order to have to deal with cross reference also between languages, we planned to have a multilingual editorial plan with, for each issue, a main article and a book review in English, and a guest article in a different language - respectively Spanish, French and Italian. The "main" and the "guest" articles presents different visual features to be managed such as color or b/w photos or images, tables, boxes and special layout and so on. The "book review" article presents an easier layout.</p>
		<p>In terms of licences, we deliberately search for only open access contents with a maximum closure of CC-BY-SA-NC in order to be able to either give to the final user complete access to the original version and be allowed to do our project (avoiding then the ND not derivate clause).</p>        
		<h3>Layout</h3>
		<p>We decided to organize the website in a two-pages website with a landing home page reporting disclaimer, documentation, and information about the team project, insensitive to layout changes and an “Issue Viewer” inner page reporting the Style-selector and the Metadataviewer sensitive to each issue.</p>
			<p>The Issue Viewer page have been organized on grid-items in order to allow an easier modification of the layout without losing responsiveness. </p>
			<p>We tough for 3-different-sized boxes to present the 3 articles of the issues: the articles can be changed of box with the “change main article” button if the user want to read one of them in the bigger box; articles can also be seen at full new tabs by double-clicking on the boxes. </p>
			<p>The overall metadata of the issue and the metadataviewer are always visible on the left side while a modal - to browse the selected entities along the issues - is visualized just once clicked on one of them. </p>
		<h3>Html and Markup</h3>
		  <p>We marked Person, Places, Organizations and keywords and we …. Qui non vado molto bene. </p>
			<p>Html: always accessible? Abbiamo sempre messo gli alt ? così gliela spariamo</p>
		<h3>Intro a css o agli stili</h3>
		  <p>We optimized specially the styled-css for chrome visualization even if we always checked the correct, even without the full special effects, for the other browsers. We deliberately not checked it for Internet Explored due to its furtcoming dismission (June 2022). </p>
			<p>
			Qualcosa su mobile e come lo gestiamo, ovvero no: </p>
			<p>
			Due to the fact that the website, showing a 3-issues viewer, is optimized to be seen on a desktop screen, we limited the optimization to proportion respect in smaller device. </p>
		<h3>To be continued</h3>
		  <p>The website is a pilot that allowed us to experiment use of interaction of html elements, css selectors and javascript and some Jquery functionalities. </p>
			<p>
			In our baby’s dreams, we planned to develop lots of further functionalities as a timeline showing time distribution for every issue, a geo-visualization of the places involved and a more detailed hierarchical organization of the places in continents, countries, cities etc. as well as Circus Companies index and so on; navigation between the issues starting from the modal in case of recurrent entities or customizable size of the viewer boxes. </p>
			<p>
			We had to deal with cruel time and real-politik against the endless space of imagination and finally we decided to go for less but solid functions. </p>
			<p>
			The mark up of the article is already prepared for these further developments. </p>

	<h2>-1799</h2>
	<h3>CULTURAL BACKGROUND: 1501, OTTAVIANO PETRUCCI and Early musical printings</h3>
	<p>For the ante quem 1800 style of our <em>Circus Magazine</em>, we decided to get inspired by the clean, elegant and essential graphics of some early examples of printed music in 16th-17th centuries. Mainly, we took as reference the work of <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottaviano_Petrucci">Ottaviano Petrucci</a> (1466-1539), but also considered coeval printed books – e.g. by Aldo Manuzio – and traditional practices in the writing and printing of music around that time.</p>
	<h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>
	<p>The retrieval of a suitable font which could be at the same time readable as well as resembling the typography of 16th century was not easy. The choice fell on the <em>IM Fell Great Primer</em> font by <a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/im-fell-great-primer-font.html">Igino Marini</a> which was used in both its normal as well as all its all capitals version (<em>IM Fell Great Primer SC</em>), as to simulate their combination and or alternation in early printed books for headings, authors, prose and poetry.</p>

	<h3>COLOURS AND IMAGES</h3>
	<p>As for it is for early printed books of music by Ottaviano Petrucci, such as the <em>Harmonice Musices Odhecaton</em> (ca. 1501), we limited our choice to a dark brown colour for ink-ish texts over the background image – set to the <code style="display: inline;">&lt;body&gt;</code> element as to resemble a unique sheet of paper. The only other colour present is the dark red with lighter red on mouse-over, inspired by ancient book’s rubricae, by decorated initials and by ancient sacred music – where musical notes where black over the four red lines staves.</p>
	<h3>LAYOUT and DETAILS</h3>
	<p>We decided to express as much as possible the essentiality and wide use of negative/white space, thus developing a quite simple and clean layout. For the Bibliographic References’ section, we customized the dotted list style by means of the rendered screenshot of a note in squared notation from the Odhecaton’s digitalization available at <a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Harmonice_Musices_Odhecaton_(Petrucci,_Ottaviano)" title="Odhecaton - IMSLP">IMSLP</a>.</p>

	<h2>1801-1900</h2>
	<h3>CULTURAL BACKGROUND: 1989, VER SACRUM</h3>
	<p>The XIX century cultural period style have been inspired by the late-century reference from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ver_Sacrum_(magazine)" target="_blank">Ver Sacrum</a> Vienna Secession’s official magazine founded by Gustav Klimt and Max Kurzweil and published from 1898 to 1903. In particular, 1898 is inspired by the first 2 year issues (1898-1899) of the magazine.</p>	
	<h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>
	<p>Lacking a specific Viennese’s secession title font, the <strong>Rivanna</strong> art-nuveau-inspired has been selected for titles and drop caps and downloaded from <a href="https://www.dafont.com/rivanna.font" target="_blank">Dafont.com</a>.</p>
	<p>For the rest of the body, we sought for a serif font which matches the <strong>Jenson font family</strong> with the typical lowercase <em>e</em> characterized by a slanted horizontal bar. The Jenson font, was originated by engraver and printer Nicolas Jenson in Venice around 1470 and one of its modern revivals  was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Type" target="_blank">Golden Type</a> made by William Morris for the publication of his Kelmscott Press. According to Daniel Verfasser Lawler (<q><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=00495123&AN=150653371&h=Lg5ByU5N16uqAc70Z4vXUCpsK1JGCz6XdhOxTi8whBDtxzxJ%2FP6xDR6KXRreyugMRUaT8vWmb59rydaCPu1tYg%3D%3D&crl=c" target="_blank">Adolf Loos, William Morris, and the Golden Type." Umění 2020: 42</a></q>), the Golden Type had a global success in the United States and in Europe. The font was widely used in Austria as well, and it was used both in <q>Ver Sacrum<q>, in the <q>Journal of the Wiener Werkstätte</q>, as well as even in Adolf Loos' <q>Das Andere</q>. Several digital edition of Jenson's font are available: the used one  is a version downloadable from <a href="http://freakfonts.com/fonts/jenson-font-download.html" target="_blank">Freakfonts</a>.</p>

		<h2>1901-1950</h2>
		<h3>CULTURAL BACKGROUND: 1926, MODERNISM</h3>
		<p>For this period we chose the <strong>Modernist movement</strong> as a reference. The movement had a deep influence not just on architectrure and design, but also on typography leading to an innovative use of compositions of text and images and fonts.</p>
		<p>Our main published references have been the art journals <q><a href="https://monoskop.org/G" target="_blank">G Material zur elementaren Gestaltung</a></q>, <q><a href="https://monoskop.org/Sovremennaya_arkhitektura" target="_blank">Sovremennaya arkhitektura</a></q>, <q><a href="https://monoskop.org/File:Bauhaus_1-1_1926.jpg" target="_blank">Bauhaus</a></q> and <q><a href="https://monoskop.org/Veshch/Gegenstand/Objet" target="_blank">Veshch Gegenstand Objet</a></q> (digital copies from <q><a href="https://monoskop.org/" target="_blank">Monoskop</a></q>).
		
		<h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>
		<p>For the header and the general frame fonts, we chose the <strong><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Staatliches" target="_blank">Staatliches Google Font</a></strong> that, 
			as declared from its source, <q>was designed in response to Herbert Bayer’s title lettering on the cover of the first 
			<a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/7567?artist_id=399&locale=en&page=1&sov_referrer=artist" alt="cover of Herbert Bayer, László Moholy-Nagy 'Staatliches Bauhaus in Weimar 1919-1923'">
			Bauhaus exhibition catalogue</a>, which was published in 1923</q>.</p>
		<p>For the article texts, we used <strong>Berthold Akzidenz-grotesk</strong> downloaded from 
			<a href="https://freefontsvault.com/akzidenz-grotesk-font-download-free/" target="_blank">FreeFontsVault.com</a>. 
			This font which was produced for the first time in 1898 by <a href="https://www.bertholdtypes.com/font/akzidenz-grotesk/proplus/" target="_blank">
			Berthold type foundry</a>, appears in some of the text from the first issue of the <q>Bauhaus</q> magazine. 
			Akzidenz-grotesk was one of the first sans-serif fonts and it served as a basis for the development of Helvetica.</p> 
		<p>The line-height has been adjusted in order to better meet the dense typography of our examples.</p>

		<h3>LAYOUT and DETAILS</h3>
		<p>We have strongly played with the grid boxes and we adopted a <strong>3-vertical columns viewer</strong> in order to reproduce the complex organization of the selected examples.</p>

	<h2>1951-1989</h2>
	<h3>CULTURAL BACKGROUND: 1959, SAUL BASS</h3>
	<p>As representative for the cultural period 1950-1989, we decided to adopt as theme the work and aesthetic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass">Saul Bass</a> (1920-1996), the graphic designer known for his title sequences and movie posters design. A strong characterization in font, a peculiar use of colours, essential, clean, creative and neat delineation of graphical areas could be of great inspiration and example for web as well as for graphical designers.</p>
	<h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>
	<p>At first, browsing on the web for fonts resembling the Saul Bass typography, we found the <em>Hitchcock</em> font by <a href="https://typographica.org/on-typography/saul-bass-website-and-hitchcock-font-are-back/">Matt Terich</a>: this seemed to be the perfect solution for our purposes, but unfortunately it had to be discarded due to its copyright policy. We then thought about the 1001 fonts’ <a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/doublebass-font.html"><em>Double Bass</em> font</a>, but this had indeed issues with the encoding of numbers, which weren’t readable indeed. 
	Thus, the choice fell on <em>Bassanova</em> by <a href="https://textfonts.net/bassanova-font.html">Julia Bausenhardt</a>, which seemed to be quite accurate as well as the previous ones, if not more. 
	We combined, throughout the <em>Issue Viewer</em>, different font sizes, decorations – e.g. using font-variant-ligatures: discretionary-ligatures – and an assorted use of colours as to express variety and to break the flow of words with highlighted and engaging keywords, bibliographical references and emphasised words, in line with the bold aesthetic of Saul Bass.</p>

	<h3>COLOURS AND IMAGES</h3>
	<p>For what concerns colour, the philosophy of Saul Bass seems to be quite straightforward: not many colours (generally 3 or 4 maximum), but vivid and striking. For our <em>Circus Magazine</em> theme, we decided to resemble as much as possible this ethos, but, of course, taking into consideration also the many layers of content available in the <em>Issue Viewer</em>. For these reasons we created a palette of the following colours and assigned them based on Saul Bass iconic title sequences or movie posters or on the semantics of our webpage – e.g. minor headings being lighter nuances of the intense colour of the major heading.</p>
	<h3>THE SKEW PROPERTY and DETAILS</h3>
	<p>In order to express the dynamic combination of areas of colours that intersect and overlay with plenty of diagonal lines instead of standards square angles, we decided to play with some content containers, such as the <code style="display: inline;">&lt;div&gt;</code> elements of the sections of the articles or the headings. By means of the css skew property, we applied a skew rotation to those elements on which this would not have resulted in a diminished readability for the web user. Some examples are the articles’s main headings, the section titles, the bibliographic references section. For this very last portion of the articles, the dotted list style was customized by means of the creation of an image from the star character with <em>Double Bass</em> font.</p>

	<h2>2040</h2>
	<h3>CULTURAL BACKGROUND: FUTURE THROUGH CINEMA AND LITERATURE</h3>
	<p>Many representations of the future have been provided, in the history of literature and cinema, giving it some recurring peculiarities.
	In order to represent a "non-existing" period's cultural background, we decided to take inspiration from the most iconic films (from different historic periods): <cite>Logan's Run</cite>, <cite>Back to the future</cite>, <cite>Terminator</cite>, <cite>Star Wars</cite>, <cite>Matrix</cite>, <cite>Marvel Cinematic Universe</cite>.</p>
	<h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>
	<p>The fonts' choice has been related to the fictional absence of handwriting in the future and the preponderance of the computer and the A.I. writing "aesthetic".
	These font families only have squared angles, due to the pixel division of a computer page.
	Some other font families are inspired by some of the most famous science-fiction film posters, all of which show a bold weight and an high width. We chose the 'Orbitron' family, which seemed to be the most suitable to the posters' aesthetics.</p>
	<div class="images" style="text-align: center;">
	<img src="locandina.jpeg" class="imgs" style="width: 30%"> 
	<img src="star wars.jpg" class="imgs" style="width: 29%">
	<img src="planet_of_apes.jpeg" class="imgs" style="width: 29.8%">
	</div>
	<p>For the main content we chose the 'Wheaton Capitals-Regular' font family, which recalls the computer codes' writing and the old Arcade games' layout (e.g. <cite>Space Invaders</cite>); in this case the choice of the colours (neon) and font properties (shadow) was essential to make it look more "futuristic".</p>

	<img src="space_invaders.gif" class="imgs" style="width: 28%"> 
	</div>

	<h3>COLOURS AND IMAGES</h3>
	The choice of the colours was pretty simple but difficult at the same time: at first, the idea was to use "fluo" colours as green, purple, blue, orange, in order to be inspired by the canonical representation of the future in cult movies; but ultimately, the purpouse was to provide an idea of how a similar platform could evolve in the future, with new more sophisticated devices and technologies. Therefore we tried to represent the absence of colours, since hologram interactive techonologies, which are more and more studied, present no colour; in particular, we tried to represent this last concept through the use of a dynamic background showing a "high-tech aesthetics" network.

	<img src="iron_man.jpeg" class="imgs" style="width: 30%">
	<img src="logan.jpeg" class="imgs" style="width: 30%">
	</div>

	<h3>OPACITY AND SHADOW PROPERTY</h3>
	<p>In order to represent the concept of transparency given by the absence of background in the fictional futuristic hologram technology, we decided to exploit the css opacity property for the text's background and the shadow property for the text. This makes it more readable and  gives it a sort of "laser" effect, recalling the old science fiction cult movies as well.
