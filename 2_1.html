“<cite>Freaks</cite>” is not a documentary. It is a Hollywood movie... <span class="entity person" about="Todd Robbins" data-sort="RobbinsTodd" data-label="Robbins, Todd">Todd Robbins</span>.
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s imagine for an instant that we acquire the marvellous ability to travel in time. We are now in <time datetime="1932">1932</time>. Let’s close our eyes for a minute and use our imagination to transport ourselves to a cinema hall in the <span class="entity place country" about="United States" data-sort="United States" data-label="United States">United States</span>(a). Let’s make ourselves comfortable in our seat to attend the debut of this fantastic and controversial film. What disturbing surprises does it have in store for us?</p>
</div>
<div id="sec_01">
<strong>1. The Story’s Main Characters.</strong> 
<div id="sec_01.1">
<p>Suddenly, we encounter a diverse group of people who really suffer from different physical and mental <span class="entity keyword" about="disability" data-sort="disability" data-label="disability">disabilities</span>. They were <span class="keyword" about="marginality" data-sort="marginality" data-label="marginality">marginalized</span> in  the  society  of  that  time  due  to their deviation from its prevailing model of beauty (and those of our modern society as well). This strange situation  seems  very  different  from  those  portrayed  in other later films, such as for example in <cite>The Elephant Man</cite><a href="">(1980)</a> by <span class="entity person" about="David Lynch" data-sort="LynchDavid" data-label="Lynch, David">David Lynch</span>, or in <cite>Mask</cite> <a href="">(1985)</a> by <span class="entity person" about="Peter Bogdanovich" data-sort="BogdanovichPeter" data-label="Bogdanovich, Peter">Peter Bogdanovich</span>, in which their <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">deformed</span> main characters are interpreted by actors whose appearance is <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">disfigured</span> by way of characterization tricks and complex make-up effects. It seems that the shooting of <cite>Freaks</cite> had to be carried out practically in secret, in an attempt to avoid the  accusations  (which  had  already  begun  circulating around  the  studios) of  the  exploitation  of  helpless,<span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">deformed</span> and <span class="entity keyword" about="disability" data-sort="disability" data-label="disability">handicapped</span> beings (Figure 1).</p>

<div id="sec_01.2">
<p><strong>2. The cinematographic treatment</strong> of the sexual relationship between the fascinating and arrogant <span class="entity keyword" about="acrobat" data-label="acrobat" data-sort="acrobat">trapeze artist</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="Cleopatra" data-label="Cleopatra" data-sort="Cleopatra">Cleopatra</span> (<span class="entity person" about="Olga Baclanova" data-label="Baclanova, Olga" data-sort="BaclanovaOlga">Olga Baclanova</span>) and the sensitive <span class="entity keyword" about="midget" data-label="midget" data-sort="midget">midget</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="Hans" data-label="Hans" data-sort="Hans">Hans</span> (<span class="entity person" about="Harry Earles" data-sort="EarlesHarry" data-label="Earles, Harry">Harry Earles</span>) could suggest aveiled intimate contact between these two characters, a topic which was completely taboo and could be contested by the censure which was in force in the <span class="entity place country" about="United States" data-sort="United States" data-label="United States">United States</span> at that time. We will just mention here that even in  the  <span class="entity place country" about="United Kingdom" data-sort="United Kingdom" data-label="United Kingdom">United  Kingdom</span> in  the  year  <time datetime="1963">1963</time>,  this  film received the rating of X.</p>

<p>3. Finally, as stated in the opening text, <strong>the discovery of  a wide range of  side-show phenomena</strong> and <strong>its stagingis</strong> not carried out within the concise context of a scientific or social documentary, but ratherin  the middle  of  a  commercial Hollywood film  that aspires to compete at the box office with other classics of the horror genre such as, for example, the successful <cite>Dracula</cite>, starring <span class="entity person" about="Bela Lugosi" data-sort="LugosiBela" data-label="Lugosi, Bela">Bela Lugosi</span> and directed by <span class="entity person" about="Tod Browning" data-sort="BrowningTod" data-label="Browning, Tod">Tod Browning</span> himself in  <span class="entity orgnization" about="Universal Studios" data-sort="Universal Studios">Universal Studios</span> in <time datetime="1931">1931.</time></p>

<h3>The Precursors</h3>

<p>In <cite>Monsey’s  Magazine</cite> in  the  year <time datetime="1931">1923</time>,  the writer <span class="entity person" about="Clarence Aaron Robbins" data-sort="RobbinsAaronClarence" data-label="Robbins, Aaron Clarence">Clarence Aaron “Todd” Robbins</span> published an original short story titled <cite>Spurs</cite>. In it, he narrated the store of <span class="entity person" about="Jacques Courbé" data-sort="CourbéJacques" data-label="Courbé, Jacques">Jacques Courbé</span>, a French <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-sort="circus" data-label="circus">circus</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="midget" data-label="midget" data-sort="midget">midget</span> who fell head-over-heels in love with his sensuous work-mate <span class="entity person" about="Jean Marie" data-sort="MarieJean" data-label="Marie, Jean">Jean  Marie</span>,  a  pretty  and  athletic  <span class="entity keyword" about="horsewoman" data-sort="horsewoman" data-label="horsewoman">horsewoman</span>. The  turbulent  relationship  between  them, and  the <span class="entity keyword" about="dysmorphism" data-label="dysmorphism" data-sort="dysmorphism">dwarf</span>’s  discovery  of  the beauty’s  betrayal  with  <span class="entity keyword" about="herbrawny male" data-sort="herbrawnymale" data-label="herbrawny male">herbrawny male</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-sort="circus" data-label="circus">circus</span> partner (<span class="entity person" about="Simon La Fleur" data-sort="LaFleurSimon" data-label="La Fleur, Simon">Simon La Fleur</span>) trigger the drama which provides the literary foundation for the  later  development  of <cite>Freaks</cite> (for  this  and  other cinematographic data consult 1).  Here, this lover’s triangle is present again (Figure 2).</p>

<p>They say that when one offends a person with a <span class="entity keyword" about="dyeformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">deformity</span> (in this case a <span class="entity keyword" about="dyeformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">dysmorphism</span>) or with a <span class="entity keyword" about="disability" data-sort="disability" data-label="disability">disability</span>, one likewise offends all similar persons, who are the <span class="entity keyword" about="disability" data-sort="disability" data-label="disability">disabled</span> brethren of the person being offended.</p>

<p>In his renowned movie <cite>Freaks</cite>, the versatile film director <span class="entity person" about="Tod Browning" data-sort="BrowningTod" data-label="Browning, Tod">Tod Browning</span> elevated this axiom to its most sublime expression. He himself was a seasoned expert in the exclusive world of the travelling <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-sort="circus" data-label="circus">circus</span>, of fairground attractions, in which he had worked as a <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clown</span>, an actor (<cite>“The Living Corpse”</cite>), a magician, a dancer and an endless array of other sporadic participations in vaudeville.</p>

<p>But there exist other celebrated works of his which have been considered precursors to <cite>Freaks</cite>. In them, the director tackled harsh stories related to <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-sort="circus" data-label="circus">circus</span> freaks. Thus, in <cite>The Unholy Three</cite> <a href>(1925)</a>, a <span class="entity keyword" about="midget" data-label="midget" data-sort="midget">midget</span>(<span class="entity person" about="Harry Earles" data-sort="EarlesHarry" data-label="Earles, Harry">Harry Earles</span>), a crazy <span class="entity keyword" about="artist" data-sort="artist" data-label="artist">ventriloquist</span> (<span class="entity person" about="Lon Chaney" data-sort="ChaneyLon" data-label="Chaney, Lon">Lon Chaney</span>) and a <span class="entity keyword" about="artist" data-sort="artist" data-label="artist">strongman</span> (<span class="entity person" about="Victor McLaglen" data-sort="McLaglenVictor" data-label="McLaglen, Victor">Victor McLaglen</span>) made up a band of ruthless robbers that operated under the cover of an innocent pet shop. He also did this in <cite>The Unknown</cite> <a href>(1927)</a>, in which a lover’s triangle made up of side-show freaks appeared (Figure 3). 
In  <time datetime="1930">1930</time>,  <span class="entity person" about="Tod Browning" data-sort="BrowningTod" data-label="Browning, Tod">Browning</span>  repeated  the  filming  of <cite><i>The  Unholy  Three</i></cite>,  this  time  in  a  sound  version,  this being the only recorded performance of <span class="entity person" about="Lon Chaney" data-sort="ChaneyLon" data-label="Chaney, Lon">Lon Chaney</span> outside of silent film; he died shortly afterwards of lung cancer.</p>

<h3>The “Freaks“ and their Pathologies</h3>

<p>Now, from a medical point of view, let’s take a look at the supposed <span class="entity keyword" about="disability" data-sort="disability" data-label="disability">clinical cases</span> that <span class="entity person" about="Tod Browning" data-sort="BrowningTod" data-label="Browning, Tod">Browning</span> showed us in his controversial film.</p>

<div id="sec_03.1">
<p><strong>1. The Midgets:</strong> The character of <span class="entity keyword" about="Hans" data-label="Hans" data-sort="Hans">Hans</span>, the real main character of the film, is interpreted by <span class="entity person" about="Harry Earles" data-sort="EarlesHarry" data-label="Earles, Harry">Harry Earles</span> (his real name was <span class="entity person" about="Kurt Schneider" data-sort="SchneiderKurt" data-label="Schneider, Kurt">Kurt Schneider</span>) (<time datetime="1902">1902</time>-<time datetime="1985">1985</time>) (Figure 4). Previously, this very same diminutive actor had played the role of the delinquent <span class="entity keyword" about="midget" data-label="midget" data-sort="midget">midget</span> in <cite>The Unholy Three</cite> <a href>(1925)</a>. Years later, he would also be part of  the cast  of <cite>The  Wizard  of   Oz</cite> <a href>(1939)</a>  by  <span class="entity person" about="Victor Fleming" data-sort="FlamingVictor" data-label="Flaming, Victor">Victor Fleming</span>. With him was the charming <span class="entity keyword" about="Frieda" data-label="Frieda" data-sort="Frieda">Frieda</span>, personified  by <span class="entity person" about="Daisy Earles" data-sort="EarlesDaisy" data-label="Earles, Daisy">Daisy  Earles</span>,  the  actress also  known  as  the <span class="entity keyword" about="Midget Mae West" data-label="Midget Mae West" data-sort="MidgetMaeWest">“Midget  Mae  West”</span>.  Often,  these  two  were  erroneously taken to be a married couple. Really, they were a  brother  and  sister  who  belonged  to  a  family  of German <span class="entity keyword" about="midget" data-label="midget" data-sort="midget">midgets</span> (they had another two sisters with the  same  pathology  who  were  named <span class="entity person" about="Grace Earles" data-sort="EarlesGrace" data-label="Earles, Grace">Grace</span>  and <span class="entity person" about="Daisy Tiny" data-sort="EarlesTiny" data-label="Earles, Tiny">Tiny</span>). They had emigrated to the <span class="entity place country" about="United States" data-sort="United States" data-label="United States">U.S.</span> during <span class="entity event" about="World War One" data-sort="WorldWarOne" data-label="World War One">World War One. The four acted together on repeated occasions under the stage name of <span class="entity organization" about="The Dancing Dolls" data-sort="TheDancingDolls" data-label="The Dancing Dolls">“The Dancing Dolls”</span> and <span class="entity organization" about="The Doll Family" data-sort="TheDollFamily" data-label="The Doll Family">“The Doll Family”</span>.
All of them suffered from the same disorder,  known  as <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">hypophysary  dwarfism</span>,  the  cause  of which is a  deficiency (complete  or  partial)  of  the human  growth  hormone  (GH).  From  the  physiopathologic point of view, this problem can be due to a disorder of the hypothalamus (the absence of thefactor of the hormone that liberates growth) or to a genetic mutation of the GH itself in the hypophysis.This results in individuals of short stature, with an infantile  appearance,  with  small  but  proportioned head,  trunk and  extremities.  This  set of  symptoms could also be due to a resistance or insensitivity to the GH. These  characteristics  distinguish  the  siblings from <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">achondroplasiac dwarfs</span>, whose <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">dwarfism</span> mainly  affects  the  growth  of  the  extremities (for  more information, consult 2 and 3).</p>

<p><span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">Achondroplasiac  dwarfism</span>  is  the  most  frequent type, and it manifests itself unquestionably already at birth. This is a hereditary bone growth disorder, of a dominant autosomal type, although it can also occuras  a  consequence  of  spontaneous mutations.  The intelligence of these individuals is usually completely normal. Rarely do any of them reach a height greaterthan 150 cm (for more information, consult 4).</p>

<p>Of all of the <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">>achondroplasiac </span> <span class="entity keyword" about="midget" data-label="midget" data-sort="midget">dwarfs</span></span> who performed in <cite>Freaks</cite></span>, we highlight above all the figure of <span class="entity person" about="Angelo  Salvatore  Rossitto" data-sort="RossittoAngeloSalvatore" data-label="Rossitto, Angelo Salvatore">Angelo  Salvatore  Rossitto</span> (also  known  as  <span class="entity keyword" about="LittleMo" data-label="Little Mo" data-sort="LittleMo">LittleMo</span>, or <span class="entity keyword" about="Angelino" data-label="Angelino" data-sort="Angelino">Angelino</span>) (<time datetime="1908">1908</time>-<time datetime="1991">1991</time>), playing the role here of <span class="entity keyword" about="Little Angelo" data-label="Little Angelo" data-sort="LittleAngelo">Little Angelo</span> (Figure 5), the <span class="entity keyword" about="midget" data-label="midget" data-sort="midget">midget</span> who danced on the guests’ table with the “loving cup“ which was supposed to seal the lover’s bond between the pretty <span class="entity keyword" about="acrobat" data-label="acrobat" data-sort="acrobat">trapeze artist</span> and the <span class="entity keyword" about="midget" data-label="midget" data-sort="midget">midget</span> <span class="entity person" about="Hans" data-label="Hans" data-sort="Hans">Hans</span>. It was precisely <span class="entity keyword" about="Little Angelo" data-label="Little Angelo" data-sort="LittleAngelo">Little Angelo</span> who was the first to suffer the ridicule of the haughty <span class="entity keyword" about="Cleopatra" data-label="Cleopatra" data-sort="Cleopatra">Cleopatra</span>, a triggering event for the merciless vengeance of the freaks. Even though he barely measured 89 cm, he was one of Hollywood’s most prolific  actors,  participating  in  more  than  70 films between <time datetime="1927">1927</time> and <time datetime="1987">1987</time>. Extremely aggressive in the defence of the fundamental rights of his ‘small’ colleagues, <span class="entity person" about="Angelo  Salvatore  Rossitto" data-sort="RossittoAngeloSalvatore" data-label="Rossitto, Angelo Salvatore">Rossitto</span> was one of the founders of the association <span class="entity organization" about="Little People of America" data-sort="LittlePeopleofAmerica" data-label="Little People of America">“Little People of America”</span>. At the end of his career, he even acted with <span class="entity person" about="Mel Gibson" data-sort="GibsonMel" data-label="Gibson, Mel">Mel Gibson</span> in the third film of the successful saga <cite>Mad Max</cite>. He passed away at 83 years of age.</p>

<div id="sec_03.2">
<p><strong>2.  The  <span class="entity keyword" about="Human  Skeleton" data-sort="HumanSkeleton" data-label="Human  Skeleton">Human  Skeleton</span>:</strong> also  known  as <span class="entity person" about="Peter Robinson" data-sort="RobinsonPeter" data-label="Robinson, Peter">Peter Robinson</span> (<time datetime= "1879">1879</time>-?) (Figure 6). In general, in the world of <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-sort="circus" data-label="circus">circus</span> performers and fairground attractions,we can distinguish two main types of <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">‘human skeletons’</span>:</p>

<p>a) Those  who  are probably affected  by  an extremely rare <span class="entity keyword" about="disability" data-sort="disability" data-label="disability">disease</span> called <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">Fibrodysplasia ossificansprogressiva</span> (Myositis Ossificans Progressiva), a group in  which  we  highlight  the classic  <span class="entity person" about="Claude  Ambroise Seurat" data-sort="SeuratClaudeAmbroise" data-label="Seurat, Claude Ambroise">Claude  Ambroise Seurat</span>. He exhibited himself as a phenomenon in the fairs of <span class="entity place continent" about="Europe" data-label="Europe" data-sort="Europe">Europe</span> at the beginning of the 19thcentury. His impoverished  figure  was  also immortalized  in  a drawing by <span class="entity person" about="Francisco de Goya" data-sort="deGoyaFrancisco" data-label="deGoya, Francisco">Francisco de Goya</span> himself, who had the opportunity to see him perform in <time datetime= "1826">1826</time> in a <span class="entity place city" about="Bordeaux" data-sort="Bordeaux" data-label="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-sort="circus" data-label="circus">circus</span>. Another noted phenomenon belonging to this group was <span class="entity person" about="Jonathan Richardson Bass" data-sort="RichardsonBassJonathan" data-label="Richardson Bass, Jonathan">Jonathan Richardson Bass</span>, whose muscles and  cartilage  hardened progressively  until  his  body became  completely  petrified.  In  contrast  to  other ‘ossified’  subjects,  <span class="entity person" about="Jonathan Richardson Bass" data-sort="RichardsonBassJonathan" data-label="Richardson Bass, Jonathan">Bass</span> always  exhibited  himself standing, supporting himself with harnesses against a vertical panel. According to witnesses who saw him, he never talked about pain and he fed himself perfectly  on  the  basis  of  a  special  liquid  diet.  Because  he could not move, he usually lived in a coffin. While he was being shown in the Huber Museum in <span class="entity place city" about="New York" data-sort="NewYork" data-label="New York">New York</span>,he contracted a fatal pneumonia that sent him to the grave at the age of 62. Finally, a similar situation was endured by <span class="entity person" about="Roy Bard" data-sort="BardRoy" data-label="Bard, Roy">Roy Bard</span>, born in <time datetime= "1884">1884</time> and completely normal until the age of 24, when the <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">ossifying disease</span> began on his left hip, then leaving his body totally rigid in only 4 years.</p>

<p>b) Other <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">living skeletons</span> may have suffered severe  disorders  of  the  muscular apparatus:  skeletal, diverse <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">muscular dystrophies</span> or strange illnesses suchas  the  so called <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">leprechaunism</span> (facial  dysmorphism, atrophy of the adipose subcutaneous tissue –lipoatro-phy- and muscular hypotrophy), total congenital <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">lipodistrophy</span> (Seip-Berardinelli  syndrome)  or generalized lipoatrophic diabetes. Here, cases can be classified suchas: <span class="entity person" about="Dolly Regan" data-sort="ReganDolly" data-label="Regan, Dolly">Dolly Regan</span> (<time datetime= "1919">1919</time>-<time datetime= "1994">1994</time>), the most famous female skeleton;  or <span class="entity person" about="James Coffey" data-sort="CoffeyJames" data-label="Coffey, James">James  Coffey</span>  (exhibited  in  <span class="entity organization" about="Barnum  & Bailey circus" data-label="Barnum  & Bailey circus" data-sort="Barnum&Baileycircus">Barnum  & Bailey circus</span>, with a height of 180 cm and a weight of 32 Kg); <span class="entity person" about="Percy Pape" data-sort="PapePercy" data-label="Pape, Percy">Percy Pape</span> (of the <span class="entity organization" about="Ringling circus" data-label="Ringling circus" data-sort="Ringlingcircus">Ringling circus</span>, who measured 186 cm and barely weighed 31 Kg); <span class="entity person" about="Harry V. Lewis" data-label="Lewis V., Harry" data-sort="LewisVHarry">Harry V. Lewis</span> (who  performed  in  the  two  big  <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-sort="circus" data-label="circus">circuses</span>,  measuring about 170  cm  and  weighing  little  more  than  36  Kg);<span class="entity person" about="Isaac W. Sprangue" data-sort="SprangueWIsaac" data-label="Sprangue W., Isaac">Isaac W. Sprangue</span> (<span class="entity organization" about="Barnum circus" data-label="Barnum circus" data-sort="Barnumcircus">Barnum circus</span>, who weighed only 20Kg  and  was  168  cm  tall); or <span class="entity person" about="Peter Robinson" data-label="Robinson, Peter" data-sort="RobinsonPeter">Peter  Robinson</span> himself(<span class="entity organization" about="Ringling circus" data-label="Ringling circus" data-sort="Ringlingcircus">Ringling circus</span>, with an approximate weight of 27 Kg).</p>

<p>Another charming  characteristic  of  these gaunt artists is that several of them married particularly fat women, side-show actress colleagues who were cast members in their shows. <span class="entity person" about="Peter Robinson" data-label="Robinson, Peter" data-sort="RobinsonPeter">Pete Robinson</span> did so with <span class="entity person" about="Bunny Smith" data-label="Smith, Bunny" data-sort="SmithBunny">Bunny Smith</span>, a robust beauty who reached the weight  of  200  Kg.  In  <cite>Freaks</cite>,  this <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">living  skeleton</span> starred  in  a  pleasant  scene  in  which  he  handed  out cigars  to  his  <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-sort="circus" data-label="circus">circus</span>  colleagues  in  celebration  of  the birth of his daughter (fruit of the relations with his wife in fiction, <span class="entity person" about="The Bearded Lady" data-sort="TheBeardedLady" data-label="The Bearded Lady">“The Bearded Lady”</span>, played by the taciturn  <span class="entity person" about="Olga Roderick" data-label="Roderick, Olga" data-sort="RoderickOlga">Olga  Roderick</span> <span class="entity person" about="Madame Olga" data-sort="MadameOlga" data-label="Madame Olga">“Madame  Olga”</span>).  Those  who knew him in life remember <span class="entity person" about="Peter Robinson" data-sort="RobinsonPeter" data-label="Robinson, Peter">Pete Robinson</span> as an affable but very stubborn fellow, especially when arguing about politics.</p>
</div>
<div id="sec_03.3">
<p><strong>3. <span class="entity person" about="The Bearded Lady" data-sort="TheBeardedLady" data-label="The Bearded Lady">The Bearded Lady</span>:</strong> her real name was <span class="entity person" about="Jane Barnell" data-sort="BarnellJane" data-label="Barnell, Jane">Jane Barnell</span> (<time datetime= "1871">1871</time>-?). If there was an actor or actress among those who participated in the filming of <cite>Freaks</cite> who really regretted it, it was without a doubt <span class="entity person" about="Olga Roderick" data-label="Roderick, Olga" data-sort="RoderickOlga">Olga Roderick</span> (<span class="entity person" about="Madame Olga" data-sort="MadameOlga" data-label="Madame Olga">Madame Olga</span>) (Figure 7). This evident discomfort can be observed in each and every one of the scenes she performs in, even in the tender scene in which she  is  portrayed  lying  exhausted  in  bed  surrounded by all of the other freaks, an unhappy convalescent after the birth of her daughter (another future <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">bearded  lady</span>?),  fruit  of  her  relationship with  the <span class="entity person" about="Human Skeleton" data-sort="HumanSkeleton" data-label="Human Skeleton">“Human Skeleton”</span>.The physiopathology of <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">hirsutism</span> is related to  an  hormonal  disorder  frequently  caused  by  the abnormal increase in androgens, which provokes alterations in the menstrual cycle, sterility, and an overall increase in body hair.On other occasions, it is a result of a specific phenomenon in certain coetaneous areas (<span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">hypertrichosis</span>) and which leads to the localized increase of an exceptionally thick and robust body hair, as is the case of the famous <span class="entity person" about="Madame Clofullia" data-sort="MadameClofullia" data-label="Madame Clofullia">Madame Clofullia</span> (<time datetime= "1831">1831</time>-?), who even managed  to  have  two  children,  or  of  the  <span class="entity person" about="Baroness Sidonia of Barcsy" data-sort="BaronessSidoniaofBarcsy" data-label="Baroness Sidonia of Barcsy">Baroness Sidonia of Barcsy</span>  (<time datetime= "1866">1866</time>-<time datetime= "1925">1925</time>),  who  also  had  offspring.

This was described for the first  time  in <time datetime="1892">1892</time>  by  <span class="entity person" about="Rudolf  Virchow" data-sort="VirchowRudolf" data-label="Virchow, Rudolf">Rudolf  Virchow</span>,  who  called  it <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">“bird-headed  dwarfism”</span>;  later,  in  <time datetime="1960">1960</time>,  Seckel would characterize this condition as we know it today.</p>

<p>This is an extremely rare congenital disease (1/10000  live  births),  of  an  autonomic  recessive nature,  characterized  by  the delay  of  intrauterine growth, microcephalia, proportioned <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">dwarfism</span> and a peculiar facial appearance (a pointed and prominentnose,  abnormally  large  eyes,  a  narrow  face,  lowly-planted  ears,  ogival  palate  and  micrognathia).Clinodactyly and microdactyly can also be detected in the extremities. Those affected by this syndrome usually  present  varying  degrees  of  mental  retardation. <span class="entity person" about="Koo Koo" data-sort="KooKoo" data-label="Koo Koo">Koo  Koo</span>  suffered  from  severe  short-sightedness, which  forced  her  to  wear  thick  glasses.  Those  who knew her remember her as having a kind-hearted and affable nature.</p>

<p><strong>5. The Hermaphrodite:</strong> of Austrian origin, <span class="entity person" about="Josephine/Joseph" data-sort="JosephineJoseph" data-label="Josephine/Joseph">Josephine/Joseph</span>  was  presented  to  the  public  with half the body of a man and the other half of a woman(Figure 9). Doubts exist as to whether this was really a case of a <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">hermaphrodite</span> or if it was a <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-sort="circus" data-label="circus">circus</span> trick. It is very interesting that, like other similar freaks (as for example  <span class="entity person" about="Albert/Alberta" data-sort="AlbertAlberta" data-label="Albert/Alberta">Albert/Alberta</span>,  <time datetime="1899">1899</time>-<time datetime="1963">1963</time>,  or  <span class="entity person" about="Freda/Fred" data-sort="FredaFred" data-label="Freda/Fred">Freda/Fred</span>,<time datetime="1908">1908</time>-?), the half of the body with the more developed musculature  and  masculine  features  was  always  the right side, while the left side was more delicate, hairless and generally endowed with a breast with feminine characteristics.</p>

<p>Currently,  the  correct  thing  is  to  speak  of intersexual states of the human species, with the term <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">‘hermaphrodite’</span> reserved for other species which are able  to  produce  masculine  and feminine  gametes simultaneously. The presentation of these <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">genetic disorders</span> is extensive and varied in human beings, with the presence of diverse <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">genital malformations</span> such as a hyperdeveloped clitoris or an atrophied penis (for more information, consult 9). In the cases we are concerned  with,  there  is  recorded  evidence  that <span class="entity person" about="Freda/Fred" data-sort="FredaFred" data-label="Freda/Fred">Freda/Fred</span> had fully formed male sexual organs. In the case of <span class="entity person" about="Albert/Alberta" data-sort="AlbertAlberta" data-label="Albert/Alberta">Albert/Alberta</span>, we are also witnessing the case of a man (named <span class="entity person" about="Harry Caro" data-sort="CaroHarry" data-label="Caro, Harry">Harry Caro</span>) impersonating a woman, to the point that he even went so far as to wear a false prosthesis of a female breast which he filled with birdseed.</p>

<p><strong>6. The <span class="keyword">Microcephalics</span>:</strong> under the care and constant  protection  of  <span class="entity person" about="Madame  Tetrallini" data-sort="MadameTetrallini" data-label="Madame Tetrallini">Madame  Tetrallini</span>,  there  are three innocent characters who can be classified in this group: the sisters <span class="entity person" about="Jeannie Lee" data-sort="LeeJeannie" data-label="Lee, Jeannie">Jeannie Lee</span> (<time datetime="1912">1912</time>-?) and <span class="entity person" about="Elvira Snow" data-sort="SnowElvira" data-label="Snow, Elvira">Elvira Snow(<time datetime="1900">1900</time>-?),  also  known  as <span class="entity person" about="Zip" data-sort="Zip" data-label="Zip">Zip</span>  and  <span class="entity person" about="Pip" data-sort="Pip" data-label="Pip">Pip</span>  or <span class="entity organization" about="The  Snow Twins" data-sort="TheSnowTwins" data-label="The  Snow Twins">“The  Snow Twins”</span> despite the fact that <span class="entity person" about="Elvira Snow" data-sort="SnowElvira" data-label="Snow, Elvira">Elvira</span> was 12 years older than  her  sister;  also, there  is  the  pleasant  <span class="entity person" about="Schlitzie" data-sort="Schlitzie" data-label="Schlitzie">Schlitzie</span> (Figure 10), <span class="entity person" about="Simon Metz" data-sort="MetzSimon" data-label="Metz, Simon">Simon Metz</span> (<time datetime="1881">1881</time>-<time datetime="1861">1861</time>), the famous character in fairground attractions such as <cite>“The Last Inca”</cite> or <cite>“The Missing Link”</cite>. All of them had severe <span class="entity keyword" about="disability" data-sort="disability" data-label="disability">mental disabilities</span>,  although  their  extreme  kind-heartedness made them seem like helpless children.</p>

<p>Most of the <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">microcephalics</span> resulted from a deficient  growth  of  the  brain  during  the  foetal  orneonatal stages, because cerebral expansion is responsible for the appropriate cranial growth. Primary causes come into play in the aetiology of this <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">malformation</span> (diverse  syndromes  of  a  genetic  origin:  Down, Cornelia de Lange syndrome [CdLS], and trisomes 13or 18), or secondary causes (such as German measlesand congenital toxoplasmosis).</p>

<p><strong>7.  Amelia and Phocomelia:</strong>  <span class="entity keyword" about="disability" data-sort="disability" data-label="disability">Amelia</span>  is defined as the total absence of one or several limbs, while <span class="entity keyword" about="disability" data-sort="disability" data-label="disability">phocomelia</span> is characterized by the lack of the middle and proximal segments and of the extremities, a condition that causes the hands to be directly inserted into the scapular spine and the feet into the pelvis. In most cases, the cause is related to genetic defects (as for example the Roberts <span class="entity keyword" about="disability" data-sort="disability" data-label="disability">phocomelia</span> syndrome),whereas cases originating from environmental factors are much less frequent (such as those unfortunately caused by thalidomide).</p>

<p>Various characters who have these types of <span class="entity keyword" about="deformity" data-label="deformity" data-sort="deformity">malformations</span> appear in <cite>Freaks</cite>: Above all we highlight <span class="entity person" about="Prince Randian" data-sort="PrinceRandian" data-label="Prince Randian">Prince Randian</span>, <span class="entity person" about="The Living Torso" data-sort="TheLivingTorso" data-label="The Living Torso">“The Living Torso”</span> (<time datetime="1881">1881</time>-<time datetime="1934">1934</time>)(Figure 11), a native of <span class="entity place country" about="British Guyana" data-sort="BritishGuyana" data-label="British Guyana">British Guyana</span> who had all four extremities missing since birth. Married and having fathered 5 children, he starred in one of the most impressive scenes in the film, in which he was able to roll a cigarette and light it calmly using only his lips.</p>

<p>Another  prodigious phenomenon included  in  this group was <span class="entity person" about="Johnny Eck" data-sort="EckJohnny" data-label="Eck, Johnny">Johnny Eck</span>, the <span class="entity person" about="Half Boy" data-sort="HalfBoy" data-label="Half Boy">“Half Boy”</span> (<time datetime="1911">1911</time>-<time datetime="1991">1991</time>)(Figure 12), who was born in a twin-birth and lacked both the lower part of his abdomen and his legs (his brother was completely normal). After a long life dedicated to show business, he died at 80 years of age.</p>

<p>We  will  conclude  with two beauties.  First, <span class="entity person" about="Frances O’Connor" data-sort="OConnorFrances" data-label="O'Connor, Frances">Frances O’Connor</span> (<time datetime="1914">1914</time>-<time datetme="1982">1982</time>) (Figure 13),  also known as the <span class="entity person" about="Living Venus de Milo" data-sort="LivingVenusdeMilo" data-label="Living Venus de Milo">“Living Venus de Milo”</span>, who made up for the congenital absence of her arms by having an extreme ability with her feet, which enabled her to eat, drink,  write  and  even  dress  herself,  as  did  <span class="entity person" about="Martha Morris" data-sort="MorrisMartha" data-label="Morris, Martha">Martha Morris</span> (?), the <span class="entity person" about="Armless Wonder" data-sort="ArmlessWonder" data-label="Armless Wonder">“Armless Wonder”</span>, whose lack of arms had its counterpart in the <span class="entity keyword" about="disability" data-sort="disability" data-label="disability">phocomelia</span> of her legs.</p>

The  tragedy of  their  life  began  at  the  very moment of birth, because they were sold by their own mother  and  exhibited  for  years  in  numerous  fair-ground attractions. They were joined at the thighs and at the waist, with independent vital organs, but with a common circulatory system. When they were finally freed from their exploitation by a judicial order, they became the masters of their own artistic destiny, coming to be the best-paid artists of this type in their time.The <span class="entity organization" about="Hilton Siamese twins" data-sort="HiltonSiamesetwins" data-label="Hilton Siamese twins">Hilton Siamese twins</span> died together in <time datetime="1969">1969</time>, victims of an epidemic of the <span class="entity place city" about="Hong Kong" data-sort="Hong Kong" data-label="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</span> flu.</p>

<p>As a curiosity, we will mention that the presence  of Siamese  sister  or  brothers was  one  of  the most  crowd-drawing  numbers  in  <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-sort="circus" data-label="circus">circuses</span>  and sideshows, so much so that on some occasions they were  even faked,  as  was  the  case  with  the  famous Austrian brothers <span class="entity organization" about="Adolph and Rudolph" data-sort="AdolphandRudolph" data-label="Adolph and Rudolph">Adolph and Rudolph</span> at the end of the 19th century.</p>
