			<p>If academic communities around the world were for several years reluctant to accept the seriousness of <span class="entity keyword" about="humor" data-sort="humor" data-label="humor">humor</span> research (see among others <a class="bib_note" id="ref1_1.3" href="#bib9_1.3">Wycoff 1999</a>), it is not particularly hard (at least for <span class="entity keyword" about="humor" data-sort="humor" data-label="humor">humor</span> researchers) to imagine what academic communities would have to say about investigating <span class="entity keyword" about="clowning" data-sort="clowning" data-label="clowning">clowning</span> and its semiotics. Scholarly research on <span class="entity keyword" about="clowning" data-sort="clowning" data-label="clowning">clowning</span> and their semiotics is indeed scarce with perhaps the recent exceptions of hospital <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> and their contribution to <span class="entity keyword" about="health topics" data-sort="health topics" data-label="health topics">patients’ psychological well-being</span> (see <a class="bib_note" id="ref2_1.3" href="#bib8_1.3">Tan Jr et al. 2014</a> and references therein) as well as <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> as prominent figures in activist stunts (see <a class="bib_note" id="ref3_1.3" href="#bib7_1.3">Sørensen 2013</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref4_1.3" href="#bib6_1.3">Ramsden 2015</a> and references there in). Non-academics also exhibit controversial attitudes towards <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span>: <em><span class="entity keyword" about="coulrophobia" data-sort="coulrophobia" data-label="coulrophobia" data-wikidata-id="Q1773212">coulrophobia</span></em>, that is, the irrational fear of  <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span>, is not uncommon among people in contemporary societies, who seem to be repelled by <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clown</span> performances and figures. As a result, <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> can be perceived not only as funny but also as discomforting and intimidating.</p>
			
			<p><span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">Bouissac</span> sets out to convince us that the semiotics of <span class="entity keyword" about="clowning" data-sort="clowning" data-label="clowning">clowning</span> is worth investigating and, what is more, that it could shed some light on people’s ambivalent perceptions of <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> and their performances. To this end, <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">he</span> draws on material collected <q>in several decades of ethnographic fieldwork in circuses and other theatres in <span class="entity place continent" about="Europe" data-sort="Europe" data-label="Europe" data-wikidata-id="Q46">Europe</span>, <span class="entity place continent" about="Asia" data-sort="Asia" data-label="Asia" data-wikidata-id="Q48">Asia</span>, and <span class="entity place continent" about="America" data-sort="America" data-label="America" data-wikidata-id="Q828">the Americas</span></q> (p. 2) to provide a detailed account of <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span>'s appearance, face makeup, costumes, and props (chapters 1–3) and their acts and narratives (chapters 4–5). <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">He</span> also explores the (European) origins of <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clown</span> figures (chapter 6) and extensively refers to specific recurrent topics in <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clown</span> performances such as sex and death (chapters 7–8). <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">Bouissac</span> conceptualizes <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> as <q>ritual transgressors of the rules and norms of civil society</q> (p. 15) (chapter 9) and examines their diverse roles in modern societies in the contexts of <span class="entity keyword" about="health topics" data-sort="health topics" data-label="health topics">medical care</span> and political movements (chapter 10). Finally, the semiotics of <span class="entity keyword" about="clowning" data-sort="clowning" data-label="clowning">clowning</span> is viewed in relation to scholarly approaches to <span class="entity keyword" about="laughter" data-sort="laughter" data-label="laughter">laughter</span> (chapter 11). In what follows, I will try to concentrate on some of the main issues/aspects of the book that seem to be most relevant to <span class="entity keyword" about="humor" data-sort="humor" data-label="humor">humor</span> research and could therefore attract the attention of <span class="entity keyword" about="humor" data-sort="humor" data-label="humor">humor</span> scholars.</p>
			
			<p>First of all, the semiotics of <span class="entity keyword" about="clowning" data-sort="clowning" data-label="clowning">clowning</span> and <span class="entity keyword" about="humor" data-sort="humor" data-label="humor">humor</span> research share a common interest in treating <span class="entity keyword" about="clowning" data-sort="clowning" data-label="clowning">clowning</span> and <span class="entity keyword" about="humor" data-sort="humor" data-label="humor">humor</span> respectively as originating in transgressions of social norms and conventions.  Everything  in <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clown</span> performances, from <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clown</span> makeup to their narratives, constitutes violations of what is widely perceived as socially accepted appearance and behaviour: <q>playing with codes of any kind is indeed the hallmark of <span class="entity keyword" about="clowning" data-sort="clowning" data-label="clowning">clowning</span></q> (p. 47). In parallel with any <span class="entity keyword" about="humor" data-sort="humor" data-label="humor">humorous</span> genre or performance, such playing does not seriously challenge or threaten the status quo: <q>[t]he <span class="entity keyword" about="ambiguity" data-sort="ambiguity" data-label="ambiguity">ambiguity</span> of the <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span>' toying with the fundamentals of culture mirrors the incessant effort of the <span class="entity keyword" about="trickster" data-sort="trickster" data-label="trickster">tricksters</span> to undermine the consistency of the rules as a way of transcending the norms and, at the same time, <em>reasserting their binding power</em><q> (p. 157; my emphasis). The <span class="entity keyword" about="laughter" data-sort="laughter" data-label="laughter">laughter</span> elicited by <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clown</span> performances functions as <q>the guardian of commonsensical norms that maintains social harmony and controls deviance</q> (p.203), thus reminding us of <span class="entity person" about="Henri-Louis Bergson" data-sort="BergonHenri" data-label="Bergson, Henri-Louis" data-wikidata-id="Q42156">Bergson</span>’s (<time datetime="1990">1990</time>/<time datetime="1990">1900</time>) theory of <span class="entity keyword" about="laughter" data-sort="laughter" data-label="laughter">laughter</span> and <span class="entity keyword" about="humor" data-sort="humor" data-label="humor">humor</span> as social correctives (see also <a class="bib_note" id="ref5_1.3" href="#bib4_1.3">Billig 2005</a>).</p>
			
			<p><span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">Clowns</span> seem to be part of a remarkably long tradition in <span class="entity place continent" about="Europe" data-sort="Europe" data-label="Europe" data-wikidata-id="Q46">Europe</span> and elsewhere. <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">Bouissac</span> refers to the existence of such traditions outside <span class="entity place continent" about="Europe" data-sort="Europe" data-label="Europe" data-wikidata-id="Q46">Europe</span> (e.g. in <span class="entity place country" about="Japan" data-sort="Japan" data-label="Japan" data-wikidata-id="17">Japan</span> and <span class="entity place country" about="Java" data-sort="Java" data-label="Java" data-wikidata-id="Q3757">Java</span>; pp. 182–195), but focuses on the presence and practices of <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> within <span class="entity place continent" about="Europe" data-sort="Europe" data-label="Europe" data-wikidata-id="Q46">Europe</span>. An interesting hypothesis put forward by the author is that <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> originate in the central figure in comical tales from pre-Christian times in <span class="entity place region" about="Northern Europe" data-sort="EuropeNorthern" data-label="Europe - northern">northern Europe</span> (<span class="entity place country" about="Germany" data-sort="Germany" data-label="Germany" data-wikidata-id="Q183">Germany</span> and <span class="entity place region" about="Scandinavia" data-sort="Scandnavia" data-label="Scandinavia" data-wikidata-id="Q21195">Scandinavia</span>) called <span class="entity keyword" about="Loki" data-sort="Loki" data-label="Loki" data-wikidata-id="Q133147">Loki</span>. <span class="entity keyword" about="Loki" data-sort="Loki" data-label="Loki" data-wikidata-id="Q133147">Loki</span> was a <q><span class="entity keyword" about="trickster" data-sort="trickster" data-label="trickster">tricksters</span> inasmuch as he transcends the divine order and freely breaks the rules, both bringing chaos and solving problems through cunning and mischievous behaviour</q> (p. 140), much like Ancient Greek god <span class="entity keyword" about="Hermes" data-sort="Hermes" data-label="Hermes" data-wikidata-id="Q41484">Hermes</span> (p. 136). Such a hypothesis seems most appealing but equally hard to investigate as sources on both European pre-Christian traditions and circus performances before the 18th century are both scarce and not particularly reliable. Furthermore, even though <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">Bouissac</span> appears to be familiar with some literature on <span class="entity keyword" about="Loki" data-sort="Loki" data-label="Loki" data-wikidata-id="Q133147">Loki</span>, he takes such knowledge for granted (even though readers may not be familiar with it at all) and does not provide any of <span class="entity keyword" about="Loki" data-sort="Loki" data-label="Loki" data-wikidata-id="Q133147">Loki</span>’s stories which could be examined in comparison to the narratives performed by <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span>. Such a contrastive analysis could better illustrate <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">the author</span>’s point and could offer some initial empirical support to his hypothesis.</p>
			
			<p><span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">Bouissac</span>  also  identifies  intertextual  relations  between  the  narratives diverse <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clown</span> performances are based on. Intertextual connections between gags and narratives are not hard to explain as <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> may adjust their gags and narratives so as to fulfil audience expectations and to create a surprise effect at the same time. So, even though <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> often modify their performances from one circus/audience to another, some similarities persist along with the differences. <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">The author</span> takes this line of thought a step further by suggesting that <q>all the circus clown acts that have been performed in European circuses over approximately the past 200 years belong to a <em>single</em> grand narrative</q> (p. 12; my emphasis). This "grand narrative", <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">Bouissac</span> suggests, involves two protagonists (at least one of which is a <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clown</span>), <q>always starts with a disruption of the expected order</q> (p. 173), and <q>hinges on a transformation of situation or status such as the breaking of an object or a rule, the loss of a game, a punishment, a reversal of fortune, or a surprising development</q> (p. 174). At the end, <q>the virtual chaos [...] is quickly brought under control [...] thus restoring the harmony that [the protagonists] disrupted at the inception of their act</q> (p. 174). Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the structure of <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clown</span> narratives bears striking resemblance to other kinds of narratives (e.g. oral, literary ones) which also evolve around one or more unexpected events that cause disruption and unsettle the equilibrium to be restored at the end of the narrative (see <a class="bib_note" id="ref6_1.3" href="#bib5_1.3">Labov 1972</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref7_1.3" href="#bib1_1.3">Archakis & Tsakona 2012</a> and references therein).</p>
			
			<p><span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">Bouissac</span> offers extensive and attractive accounts of <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> gags and (on-and off-stage) narratives as viewed and framed from an ethnographer’s perspective, which is one of the most appealing aspects of the study. Sometimes, however, the narrative of the performances lack a detailed analysis that would cover the whole narrative (and not just a small part of it) and would help the reader understand why such accounts are important for the theoretical point(s) <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">the author</span> wishes to make. Thus, theorizing is sometimes implicitly assigned to the implied reader.</p> 
			
			<p>Organising the content of his book, <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">Bouissac</span> opts for a bottom-up approach. He begins with the exhaustive description of <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span>’ appearances, costumes, and props, then he moves to their gags and narratives and to the topics of these narratives, so as to eventually discuss intertextual connections and make cross-cultural comparisons. Thus, <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">he</span> leaves purely theoretical issues for the final chapter: chapter 11 is dedicated to diverse approaches to <span class="entity keyword" about="laughter" data-sort="laughter" data-label="laughter">laughter</span> which are deemed pertinent to the semiotics of <span class="entity keyword" about="clowning" data-sort="clowning" data-label="clowning">clowning</span>. Such a bottom-up approach –albeit uncommon among <span class="entity keyword" about="humor" data-sort="humor" data-label="humor">humor</span>researchers –is welcome as it highlights the details of <span class="entity keyword" about="clowning" data-sort="clowning" data-label="clowning">clowning</span> performances and introduces the readers to the activities, the profession, and the culture of <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span>. One of the major contributions of the book is that, after reading it, watching <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clown</span> performances can never be the same: <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">the author</span> guides us through the semiotics of <span class="entity keyword" about="clowning" data-sort="clowning" data-label="clowning">clowning</span> in such detail that every move and feature of <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clown</span> acts will be overloaded with meaning(s) for the readers of the book. This is significant not only for those who are already familiar with <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> but mostly for those who have not so far been <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clown</span> fans or for those who may be irrationally scared of <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> (see <em><span class="entity keyword" about="coulrophobia" data-sort="coulrophobia" data-label="coulrophobia" data-wikidata-id="Q1773212">coulrophobia</span></em> above). And, of course, it is significant for those who so far thought that <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> performances are impromptu and meaningless sketches without any sociocultural and political connotations and performed merely to amuse the audience (on the political connotations of <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> performances, see pp. 42, 55–56,and chapter 7). The author indeed succeeds in showing that <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> performances <q>are more complex and sophisticated than is usually thought</q> (p. 204).</p>
			
			<p>However, in the final, theoretically oriented chapter of the book, when <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">the author</span> attempts to connect his data and analyses with theoretical approaches and literature on <span class="entity keyword" about="laughter" data-sort="laughter" data-label="laughter">laughter</span>, the result seems not adequately convincing for the reader. <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">Bouissac</span> is undoubtedly familiar with studies and findings covering a wide range of disciplines and methodologies, but does not seem to manage to form a coherent and solid theoretical proposal that would allow him to offer a well-defined and to-the-point account of <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clown</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="laughter" data-sort="laughter" data-label="laughter">laughter</span>. <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">He</span> critically discusses various viewpoints on the uses and functions of <span class="entity keyword" about="laughter" data-sort="laughter" data-label="laughter">laughter</span> in general, but does not clearly tell us which functions and aspects of <span class="entity keyword" about="laughter" data-sort="laughter" data-label="laughter">laughter</span> emerge as relevant to <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> acts.</p> 
			
			<p>Furthermore, even though <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">the author</span> clearly states that <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> gags are based on surprise (pp. 76–77), that <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> performances consist of narratives based on unexpected events (pp. 173–180), and that in general <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> display <q>transgressive behaviour verging on cultural subversion when [they] ignore the tacit rules of social games</q> (p. 11), any mention of the incongruity theory of <span class="entity keyword" about="laughter" data-sort="laughter" data-label="laughter">laughter</span> and <span class="entity keyword" about="humor" data-sort="humor" data-label="humor">humor</span> is notably absent from the theoretical discussion of the final chapter (on the incongruity theory, see among others <a class="bib_note" id="ref8_1.3" href="#bib2_1.3">Attardo 1994: 47–49</a> and references therein). In other words, although <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">Bouissac</span> dedicates most (if not all) of his book to explaining how and why <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> figures and performances are inextricably linked to flouting social conventions and to violating expectations, <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">he</span> refrains from exploiting incongruity theory to account for such flouting and violations.</p>
			
			<p>Nevertheless, <span class="entity person" about="Paul Bouissac" data-sort="BouissacPaul" data-label="Bouissac, Paul">Bouissac</span>’s study remains a reader-friendly  book  and  an  invaluable ethnographic approach to an area of study that has been most neglected by (<span class="entity keyword" about="humor" data-sort="humor" data-label="humor">humor</span> and other) scholars. It is particularly interesting for <span class="entity keyword" about="humor" data-sort="humor" data-label="humor">humor</span> researchers, especially those who investigate <span class="entity keyword" about="clown" data-sort="clown" data-label="clown">clowns</span> performances in or, mostly nowadays, outside circuses (e.g. in <span class="entity keyword" about="health topics" data-sort="health topics" data-label="health topics">hospitals</span>, political activist stunts, street performances). The book could definitely incite potential readers to engage not only in various forms of amateur or professional <span class="entity keyword" about="clowning" data-sort="clowning" data-label="clowning">clowning</span> but, most importantly, to continue this promising and fascinating line of research.</p>
