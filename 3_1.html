		<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>At the end of <time>2016</time>, there were an estimated 22.5 million <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugees</span> worldwide, which is the highest number in <time>20 years</time> (<a class="bib_note" id="ref1_3.1" href="#bib59_3.1">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 2017</a>). The <span class="entity organization" about="Refugee Convention" data-label="Refugee Convention" data-sort="Refugee Convention"><time>1951</time> Refugee Convention</span> defines a <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> as <q>someone who is unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a  well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion</q> (<a class="bib_note" id="ref2_3.1" href="#bib58_3.1">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 2010: 3</a>). Of the <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugees</span>, 51 per cent were under 18. <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">Refugee</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> and adolescents may go through three phases of stressful situations: the period in the country of origin (pre-flight), the period of the flight and the period of resettlement in the new country (post-flight) (<a class="bib_note" id="ref3_3.1" href="#bib16_3.1">Fazel and Stein 2002</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref4_3.1" href="#bib27_3.1">Lustig et al. 2004</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref5_3.1" href="#bib40_3.1">Pacione et al. 2013</a>). Potentially traumatic experiences in the country of origin include exposure to violence, loss of family and friends, limited or no access to education and general insecurity (<a class="bib_note" id="ref6_3.1" href="#bib4_3.1">Berman 2001</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref7_3.1" href="#bib16_3.1">Fazel and Stein 2002</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref8_3.1" href="#bib27_3.1">Lustig et al. 2004</a>). During the flight, children and youngsters are forced to leave their homes, sometimes separated from care-givers, and can be exposed to dangerous situations (<a class="bib_note" id="ref9_3.1" href="#bib4_3.1">Berman 2001</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref10_3.1" href="#bib16_3.1">Fazel and Stein 2002</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref11_3.1" href="#bib27_3.1">Lustig et al. 2004</a>). During settlement in the new country, other stressors are present, such as adaptation to a new culture and language, the asylum process that entails uncertainty and fear, social isolation and racial discrimination (<a class="bib_note" id="ref12_3.1" href="#bib14_3.1">Ehntholt and Yule 2006</a>).</p> 
			<p>Traumatic experiences pose a risk to mental health and can negatively influence children’s cognitive, emotional and social development (<a class="bib_note" id="ref13_3.1" href="#bib14_3.1">Ehntholt and Yule 2006</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref14_3.1" href="#bib44_3.1">Peltonen and Punama¨ ki 2010</a>). Exposure to conflict-related <span class="entity keyword" about="trauma" data-label="trauma" data-sort="trauma" data-wikidata-id="Q654426">trauma</span> is associated with high levels of anxiety, depression, behavioural disorders (<a class="bib_note" id="ref15_3.1" href="#bib12_3.1">Dimitry 2011</a>), hypo or hyper-responsivity of children (<a class="bib_note" id="ref16_3.1" href="#bib15_3.1">Falasca and Caulfield 1999</a>) and problems with <span class="entity keyword"  about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span> (<a class="bib_note" id="ref17_3.1" href="#bib52_3.1">Strauser et al. 2006</a>). A study among Israeli adolescents who had been exposed to terrorism found that they displayed high rates of risk-taking behaviours, including fighting, disobeying parents and school authorities, and using drugs (<a class="bib_note" id="ref18_3.1" href="#bib42_3.1">Pat-Horenczyk et al. 2007</a>). Moreover, human rights violations and traumatic events may lead to a lack of <span class="entity keyword" about="interpersonal trust" data-label="interpersonal trust" data-sort="interpersonal trust">interpersonal trust</span>, because it is often unclear who can be trusted in the context of collective violence (<a class="bib_note" id="ref19_3.1" href="#bib52_3.1">Strauser et al. 2006</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref20_3.1" href="#bib38_3.1">Nickerson et al. 2014</a>).</p> 
			<p>Traumatic experiences do not always lead to sustained mental health problems (<a class="bib_note" id="ref21_3.1" href="#bib44_3.1">Peltonen and Punama¨ ki 2010</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref22_3.1" href="#bib41_3.1">Panter-Brick et al. 2015</a>). The majority of children and <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span> who have experienced highly stressful situations show resilience or even post-traumatic growth (<a class="bib_note" id="ref23_3.1" href="#bib2_3.1">Barber 2013</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref24_3.1" href="#bib41_3.1">Panter-Brick et al. 2015</a>). Resilience is defined as <q>the ability to maintain stable, healthy psychological and physical functioning despite being confronted with significant <span class="entity keyword" about="trauma" data-label="trauma" data-sort="trauma" data-wikidata-id="Q654426">trauma</span></q> (<a class="bib_note" id="ref25_3.1" href="#bib40_3.1">Pacione et al. 2013: 341</a>). During post-traumatic growth, improved levels of functioning are obtained after traumatic experiences (<a class="bib_note" id="ref26_3.1" href="#bib54_3.1">Tedeschi and Calhoun 2004</a>).</p> 
			<p>The psychological outcomes of <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> children and <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span> cannot be predicted by simply weighing the risks and protective factors (<a class="bib_note" id="ref27_3.1" href="#bib56_3.1">Tol et al. 2013</a>). Rather, resilience results from complex interactions between many factors on different levels (<a class="bib_note" id="ref28_3.1" href="#bib30_3.1">McAdam-Crisp 2006</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref29_3.1" href="#bib48_3.1">Sapienza and Masten 2011</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref30_3.1" href="#bib56_3.1">Tol et al. 2013</a>). First, psychological outcomes are related to the number of traumatic experiences and the nature of the <span class="entity keyword" about="trauma" data-label="trauma" data-sort="trauma" data-wikidata-id="Q654426">trauma</span>. <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">Children</span> and youngsters who have experienced more traumatic experiences are more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or have psychological adjustment difficulties (<a class="bib_note" id="ref31_3.1" href="#bib46_3.1">Punama¨ ki et al. 1997</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref32_3.1" href="#bib15_3.1">Falasca and Caulfield 1999</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref33_3.1" href="#bib41_3.1">Panter-Brick et al. 2015</a>). <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">Children</span> who live in chronic conditions of war and military violence have a lower risk of developing PTSD than children who have been exposed directly and personally to severe violence and losses (<a class="bib_note" id="ref34_3.1" href="#bib44_3.1">Peltonen and Punama¨ ki 2010</a>) or direct personal injury (<a class="bib_note" id="ref35_3.1" href="#bib19_3.1">Geltman et al. 2005</a>).</p> 
			<p>Second, while social support has been identified as an important factor for the development of resilience and post-traumatic growth, social isolation and a lack of social support have been identified as risk factors for developing PTSD (<a class="bib_note" id="ref36_3.1" href="#bib27_3.1">Lustig et al. 2004</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref37_3.1" href="#bib14_3.1">Ehntholt and Yule 2006</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref38_3.1" href="#bib11_3.1">Daud et al. 2008</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref39_3.1" href="#bib33_3.1">Meyerson et al. 2011</a>). Good relationships with peers represent a protective factor (<a class="bib_note" id="ref40_3.1" href="#bib11_3.1">Daud et al. 2008</a>), while a lack of close friendships is a risk factor for the development of mental health problems (<a class="bib_note" id="ref41_3.1" href="#bib45_3.1">Peltonen et al. 2010</a>). Family, particularly parents, may also protect children and adolescents from developing mental health problems by offering safety, care and support (<a class="bib_note" id="ref42_3.1" href="#bib11_3.1">Daud et al. 2008</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref43_3.1" href="#bib44_3.1">Peltonen and Punama¨ ki 2010</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref44_3.1" href="#bib56_3.1">Tol et al. 2013</a>). Finally, the perceived support and a sense of security offered by teachers are associated with post-traumatic growth (<a class="bib_note" id="ref45_3.1" href="#bib62_3.1">Yu et al. 2010</a>).</p> 
			<p>Personal characteristics are also related to psychological outcomes after traumatic experiences (<a class="bib_note" id="ref46_3.1" href="#bib1_3.1">Almqvist and Broberg 1999</a>). Positive <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span> enhances resilience (<a class="bib_note" id="ref47_3.1" href="#bib11_3.1">Daud et al. 2008</a>), while low <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span> is associated with a higher risk of depression (<a class="bib_note" id="ref48_3.1" href="#bib18_3.1">Fox et al. 2004</a>). In addition, a structure to daily life and the undertaking of new projects are considered to be important for the mental health of <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugees</span> (<a class="bib_note" id="ref49_3.1" href="#bib35_3.1">Miller and Rasco 2004</a>).</p> 
			<p>Interventions can promote resilience in <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span> by supporting protective factors and mechanisms (<a class="bib_note" id="ref50_3.1" href="#bib60_3.1">Weine 2011</a>). While psychiatric interventions are aimed at the treatment of mental disorders in individuals, <span class="entity keyword" about="psycho-social interventions" data-label="psycho-social interventions" data-sort="psycho-social interventions">psycho-social interventions</span> aim to promote psycho-social wellbeing and to prevent or treat mental health problems in broad populations by restoring social infrastructures through the use of activities (<a class="bib_note" id="ref51_3.1" href="#bib6_3.1">Betancour and Williams 2008</a>). <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> is a <span class="entity keyword" about="psycho-social interventions" data-label="psycho-social interventions" data-sort="psycho-social interventions">psycho-social intervention</span> involving <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes and has been offered since the beginning of the <time>1990s</time> (<a class="bib_note" id="ref52_3.1" href="#bib25_3.1">LaFortune and Bouchard 2011</a>). In the literature, slightly different definitions of the concept of a <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> exist; however, there is one important aspect in which these definitions agree: <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> is seen as a tool for achieving social or personal goals (<a class="bib_note" id="ref53_3.1" href="#bib8_3.1">Caravan n.d.</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref54_3.1" href="#bib9_3.1">Cirque du Soleil n.d.</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref55_3.1" href="#bib25_3.1">LaFortune and Bouchard 2011</a>). <span class="organization">Cirque du Soleil</span> (<a href="#">n.d.: 1</a>) gives the following definition:</p> 
				<blockquote><span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> is an innovative social intervention approach, which uses the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> arts as a tool for fostering the personal and social development of atrisk individuals. . . . The primary goal of this approach is not merely to learn <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> arts. Rather, it’s designed to help participants achieve personal and social development by nurturing their <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span> and trust in others, teaching them social skills, inspiring them to become active citizens, and helping them to express their creativity and explore their potential.</blockquote> 
			<p><span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> is provided as an intervention for <span class="entity keyword" about="vulnerable groups" data-label="vulnerable groups" data-sort="vulnerable groups">vulnerable groups</span>, such as <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span> with mental health problems, physically disabled people and <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugees</span> (<a class="bib_note" id="ref56_3.1" href="#bib25_3.1">LaFortune and Bouchard 2011</a>). Several aims for <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> projects have been mentioned in the literature, including combatting isolation and exclusion (<a class="bib_note" id="ref57_3.1" href="#bib3_3.1">Bassel 2005</a>), learning discipline, gaining trust in other people, expressing emotions (<a class="bib_note" id="ref58_3.1" href="#bib8_3.1">Caravan n.d.</a>), promoting a healthy lifestyle (<a class="bib_note" id="ref59_3.1" href="#bib17_3.1">Fournier et al. 2014</a>) and developing <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span> (<a class="bib_note" id="ref60_3.1" href="#bib8_3.1">Caravan n.d.</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref61_3.1" href="#bib25_3.1">LaFortune and Bouchard 2011</a>). These aims are pursued by teaching participants <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> acts, such as juggling, acrobatics and balancing acts, and having them perform these acts for an audience. The following characteristics of <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> may contribute to achieving those aims: an encouraging atmosphere, acceptance of failure, opportunities to experience success, a focus on controlling the body by learning challenging tricks (<a class="bib_note" id="ref62_3.1" href="#bib57_3.1">Trotman 2013</a>) and expression and creativity (<a class="bib_note" id="ref63_3.1" href="#bib25_3.1">LaFortune and Bouchard 2011</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref64_3.1" href="#bib57_3.1">Trotman 2013</a>). Positive effects of <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> may expand to other life domains and might even have positive effects at a community level (<a class="bib_note" id="ref65_3.1" href="#bib5_3.1">Bessone 2017</a>).</p> 
			<p>Although few studies have explored the outcomes of <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> projects, several positive effects have been identified. An evaluation of <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span> in <span class="entity place city" about="Paris" data-label="Paris" data_sort="Paris" data-wikidata-id="Q90">Paris</span> showed that participation in a <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> camp decreased feelings of loneliness and isolation (<a class="bib_note" id="ref66_3.1" href="#bib3_3.1">Bassel 2005</a>). In <span class="entity place country" about="Finland" data-label="Finland" data-sort="Finland" data-wikidata-id="Q33">Finland</span>, a study using surveys and interviews with participants, teachers, instructors, nurses and specialists revealed positive results for the participants, such as increased <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span>, self-confidence, concentration and more interaction with others (<a class="bib_note" id="ref67_3.1" href="#bib24_3.1">Kinunnen et al. 2013</a>). A qualitative study among parents and teachers of a community <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> project in <span class="entity place country" about="New Zealand" data-label="New Zealand" data-sort="New Zealand" data-wikidata-id="Q664">New Zealand</span> also identified outcomes such as increased <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span> and confidence, positive interactions, interpersonal acceptance and a greater trust in others (<a class="bib_note" id="ref68_3.1" href="#bib57_3.1">Trotman 2013</a>). A <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> project in <span class="entity place country" about="Mexico" data-label="Mexico" data-sort="Mexico" data-wikidata-id="Q96">Mexico</span> was found to increase the self-confidence and expressivity of at-risk <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span> and appeared to increase the social support networks of participants’ parents (<a class="bib_note" id="ref69_3.1" href="#bib32_3.1">McCauley 2011</a>). A mixedmethods study in <span class="entity place region" about="Quebec" data-label="Quebec" data-sort="Quebec" data-wikidata-id="Q176">Quebec</span> found that <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> participants experienced personal growth, which was related to the increased social inclusion and engagement of marginalized <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span> (<a class="bib_note" id="ref70_3.1" href="#bib50_3.1">Spiegel and Parent 2017</a>). A large-scale study in <span class="entity place country" about="Ecuador" data-label="Ecuador" data-sort="Ecuador" data-wikidata-id="Q736">Ecuador</span>, also using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, found similar effects on the individual and social level of <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> programmes. These effects appeared at least partially specific to <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> arts (in comparison with other community arts such as music or dance) (<a class="bib_note" id="ref71_3.1" href="#bib51_3.1">Spiegel et al. 2019</a>).</p>

			<p>Since <time>2011</time>, the non-governmental organization <span class="organization">Her Yerde Sanat Derneg˘ i</span> (<a class="bib_note" id="ref85_3.1" href="#bib22_3.1">n.d.</a>) (<span class="organization">Art Anywhere Association</span>) has organized events, projects, workshops and festivals involving different art forms for children and <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span> in and around <span class="entity place city" about="Mardin" data-label="Mardin" data-sort="Mardin" data-wikidata-id="Q188022">Mardin</span>, in south-east <span class="entity place country" about="Turkey" data-label="Turkey" data-sort="Turkey" data-wikidata-id="Q43">Turkey</span>. In <time>February 2016</time>, this association started its first weekly course for children and <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span>, offering a mix of <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> and language classes supplemented by visual-arts and music classes. At that time, <span class="entity place country" about="Turkey" data-label="Turkey" data-sort="Turkey" data-wikidata-id="Q43">Turkey</span> hosted over 2.5 million Syrian <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugees</span> (<a class="bib_note" id="ref86_3.1" href="#bib59_3.1">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 2017</a>), many of whom stayed in border regions such as <span class="entity place city" about="Mardin" data-label="Mardin" data-sort="Mardin" data-wikidata-id="Q188022">Mardin</span>.

		<h3>Materials and Methods</h3> 
			<h5>Location and Intervention</h5> 
				<p>Data were collected during the relatively new <span class="entity keyword" about="Sirkhane project" data-label="Sirkhane project" data-sort="Sirkhane project">Sirkhane</span> course held in <span class="entity place city" about="Mardin" data-label="Mardin" data-sort="Mardin" data-wikidata-id="Q188022">Mardin</span>, <span class="entity place country" about="Turkey" data-label="Turkey" data-sort="Turkey" data-wikidata-id="Q43">Turkey</span>, from the end of <time>February 2016 until the end of April 2016</time>. During this time, around 50 children and youths participated in the course, with ages varying from five to 20 years old, although most of the participants were aged 12–16. The children and youths were invited to participate in the classes either directly by the organization or through their social network. Most of the participants were originally from <span class="entity place country" about="Syria" data-label="Syria" data-sort="Syria" data-wikidata-id="Q858">Syria</span>, although some Turkish and Iraqi children and adolescents also participated. Most participants had already lived in <span class="entity place country" about="Turkey" data-label="Turkey" data-sort="Turkey" data-wikidata-id="Q43">Turkey</span> for several years.</p> 
				<p>The children followed a five-hour programme two days a week. Whereas the children were always taught in the same group, multiple groups of children joined the programme on different days and times. Each group took classes in the Turkish language and <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> skills, supplemented with English language, music, dance and visual-arts classes. Classes took place for two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon, with a joint lunch break between these sessions. The <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes included games and exercises for warming up and training in several <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> disciplines, such as acrobatics (alone or in groups, static or dynamic movements), aerials (such as static trapeze), juggling (such as juggling balls and spinning plates) and balancing disciplines (e.g. walking on a rope or standing on a large ball). The classes had started three weeks before the start of this study.</p> 
			<h5>Procedure</h5> 
				<p>A qualitative participative study design was used. Information was gathered through interviews and observations by the first author—a researcher who also participated in the programme as a voluntary <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> teacher. Participants were asked to fill out questionnaires about <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span>, <span class="entity keyword" about="interpersonal trust" data-label="interpersonal trust" data-sort="interpersonal trust">interpersonal trust</span> and social support but, due to language difficulties, this data was insufficiently reliable for analyses and reporting. The difficulties faced and recommendations for future research are discussed later.</p> 
			<h5>Respondents</h5> 
				<p>The selection of youngsters for interviews was based on maximum-variation sampling. Participants were selected to maximize diversity, particularly in sex, age and amount of experience with the circus, as some of them had taken <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes in the past (<a class="bib_note" id="ref87_3.1" href="#bib43_3.1">Patton 2002</a>). Most parents of the interviewed participants were also interviewed themselves, although a few could not participate due to transportation problems and work responsibilities. Teachers were selected based on their availability for an interview during the period of research.</p> 
				<p>The inclusion of new respondents finished when data saturation was reached. A total of 20 respondents were interviewed, including 11 participants, seven parents and two teachers (see <a href="#">Table 1</a>). The participants, six girls and five boys, were aged between 12 and 20 years old. Nine of them participated in the new <span class="entity keyword" about="Sirkhane project" data-label="Sirkhane project" data-sort="Sirkhane project">Sirkhane</span> course, while two had already been involved in other activities and had begun training as teachers in the project. The participants had lived in <span class="entity place country" about="Turkey" data-label="Turkey" data-sort="Turkey" data-wikidata-id="Q43">Turkey</span> for a period of between <time>nine months</time> and <time>five years</time>, and were all Syrian except for one participant, who came from <span class="entity place country" about="Iraq" data-label="Iraq" data-sort="Iraq" data-wikidata-id="Q796">Iraq</span>. The parents were all mothers of one to three participating children and adolescents, except for one participant’s sister-in-law, who is also mentioned as a <q>parent</q> in the <a href="#">Results section</a> because she serves that role in the <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">child</span>’s daily life. One mother also worked as a teacher in the project, and she functioned as one of the interpreters.</p> 
				<p>All respondents gave consent to participate in the interviews and for the interviews to be recorded. The participants all consented to the anonymous use of their information gathered from the interviews. <span class="organization">Her Yerde Sanat Derneg˘ i</span> also permitted the undertaking of this research and the use of the observations, and they participated by approaching the parents and children regarding this research and in obtaining consent. It was agreed that the authors of this study would not explicitly ask about war-related topics to avoid recalling traumatic experiences among the respondents. All names reported in this study are pseudonyms, and some core information has been altered to make the respondents untraceable.</p>

				<p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted over <time>five weeks</time>. Topic lists for the interviews were adapted several times in response to a preliminary analysis by the three authors and based on participants’ answers, to increase the validity of the study (<a class="bib_note" id="ref88_3.1" href="#bib36_3.1">Morse et al. 2002</a>). The final topic lists can be found in <a href="#">Appendices A</a>, <a href="#">B</a> and <a href="#">C</a>. Questions were constructed to explore the possible effects of the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> activities from the perspective of the participants and their parents and teachers. By also interviewing the parents and teachers about the changes they observed in all children, and particularly in the children who were interviewed, the data obtained in the children’s interviews was triangulated.</p> 
				<p>In total, 19 interviews were conducted, with an average length of <time>33 minutes</time>. All interviews took place at the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> school itself, except for one interview that took place through an online phone call. All interviews were conducted individually, except for one interview with two parents who were coincidentally present at the same time. Interpreters were employed for the majority of the interviews. Four interviews were conducted in English without translators, 13 were conducted in Arabic, one in Turkish and one in Kurdish with translators. The language used was either the respondent’s mother tongue or a second language that they had sufficiently mastered. Two nonprofessional interpreters, who were also involved in the project as teachers, served as translators. The mother tongue of both interpreters was a language other than English, which can be seen in the quality of the language in some of the quotes in the Results section. The advantages and disadvantages of working with involved, non-professional interpreters are discussed in the <a href="#">Discussion section</a>. We felt that the presence of other parents, interpreters and teachers helped the participants to feel comfortable and build rapport. To help prevent socially desirable answers and positive evaluations of the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> due to the presence of contributors to the course, points for improvement and negative elements of the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes were explicitly requested. In addition, the primary focus was on elucidating concrete experiences and examples, rather than normative evaluations.</p> 
			<h5>Observations</h5> 
				<p>Unstructured, participative observations were made during <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes, lunch breaks and in the town of <span class="entity place city" about="Mardin" data-label="Mardin" data-sort="Mardin" data-wikidata-id="Q188022">Mardin</span>. Participants were not always aware that they were being observed (<a class="bib_note" id="ref89_3.1" href="#bib43_3.1">Patton 2002</a>). As far as language allowed, small talk was frequently conducted (<a class="bib_note" id="ref90_3.1" href="#bib13_3.1">Driessen and Jansen 2013</a>). The observations included all participants of the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes, not just those who had been interviewed. Notable events and observations were converted to field notes as often as possible immediately after each class, break or event. These field notes were used to further triangulate the data obtained in the interviews. </p>
			<h5>Analysis</h5> 
				<p>Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and, together with all field notes, imported into ATLAS.ti, a software programme for qualitative data analysis. All data was open-coded, which resulted in a list of codes, such as <q>bored at home</q>, <q>teachers take care</q>, <q>spending energy</q> and <q>sense of competence</q>. The initial codes were further clustered into categories by the three authors, such as <q>living circumstances</q>, <q>behavioural changes</q>, <q>showing yourself</q> and <q>future perspective</q>. Finally, the results were analysed based on the defined codes and categories, and illustrated with typical quotes and fragments of field notes.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3> 
			<p>To conclude the effects of <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> activities, it is essential to know more about the living circumstances and problems that participants and their families faced. The living circumstances are therefore described first. The effects of the <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> classes on participants’ lives are then discussed and their behavioural changes are described. The first author conducted interviews and observations. The results are described from their perspective, although the interview set-up and topic lists, interpretations and analyses were discussed with all authors. The quotes use literal transcripts indicating the language used by the respondents or translators, in order to be transparent in all elements of our analysis, including that of our interpretation of specific formulations and language struggles.</p> 
			<h5>Living Circumstances</h5> 
				<h6>Lack of activities</h6> 
					<p>One of the main topics that came up in the interviews was the lack of access to daytime activities. One participant, <span class="entity person" about="Rowan" data-label="Rowan" data-sort="Rowan">Rowan</span>, described her situation as follows:</p> 
						<blockquote>At home I just sit, like this, I don’t do anything. . . . I didn’t like to come here to <span class="entity place country" about="Turkey" data-label="Turkey" data-sort="Turkey" data-wikidata-id="Q43">Turkey</span>, I want to stay in <span class="entity place country" about="Syria" data-label="Syria" data-sort="Syria" data-wikidata-id="Q858">Syria</span>. . . . I feel here so boring, because I’m alone at home. But in <span class="entity place country" about="Syria" data-label="Syria" data-sort="Syria" data-wikidata-id="Q858">Syria</span> we were together.</blockquote> 
					<p><span class="entity person" about="Rowan" data-label="Rowan" data-sort="Rowan">Rowan</span> and other participants and parents identified two things that made them feel bored: being alone at home, or <q>not have friends close to home</q>, and having nothing to do. Another parent described her children as <q>lost</q>, without school, friends or a place to go. As a consequence, the youngsters hung around in the streets. Similarly, the first author of this article observed that <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> participants hung around in the streets, sometimes playing games, but most of the time doing nothing in particular. When passed, they would enthusiastically greet the first author, and the first author was sometimes asked whether they could join them in the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> to do some training. <q>Loitering in the streets</q> was also mentioned negatively by some parents, who emphasized that <q>organized play</q> is preferable to hanging around in the streets.</p> 
					<p>In one group, most participants went to school in <span class="entity place city" about="Mardin" data-label="Mardin" data-sort="Mardin" data-wikidata-id="Q188022">Mardin</span>, but most of the other group’s participants did not attend school or only on an irregular basis. Some had gone to school in their country of origin, or <span class="entity place city" about="Mardin" data-label="Mardin" data-sort="Mardin" data-wikidata-id="Q188022">Mardin</span>, but had decided not to attend anymore. Many respondents described the situation of their former school in <span class="entity place country" about="Syria" data-label="Syria" data-sort="Syria" data-wikidata-id="Q858">Syria</span> or a Syrian school they had attended in <span class="entity place city" about="Mardin" data-label="Mardin" data-sort="Mardin" data-wikidata-id="Q188022">Mardin</span>; for example:</p> 
						<blockquote>There [at school] they punish us. And shout. They treat with us very bad. . . .</blockquote> 
					<p>I do my best to do not stand in a position that I need punishment. I become quiet and don’t do anything bad. Here, <span class="entity person" about="Amena" data-label="Amena" data-sort="Amena">Amena</span> describes punishment in school, and later she said she preferred learning at the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> for that reason. Some parents stated that their children did not feel safe at school and became afraid of the teachers. A lack of adequate teaching style and having <q>no care</q> for the children were also mentioned by some parents. In other cases, the youngsters said they needed to work to earn money for their families and therefore could not go to an ordinary school. The first author also observed several young Syrian individuals working in different places in <span class="entity place city" about="Mardin" data-label="Mardin" data-sort="Mardin" data-wikidata-id="Q188022">Mardin</span>, such as in food stores.</p> 
				<h6>Position in society</h6> 
					<p>Besides a lack of activities and feeling isolated from friends, other consequences of being a <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> were discussed with the informants. <span class="entity person" about="Rowan" data-label="Rowan" data-sort="Rowan">Rowan</span>’s parent, for example, explained:</p> 
						<blockquote>We escape from a war and suffering and our children watched all of this there. Now we want our children to forget that pain, that war. And continue their life in safety and better life than now.</blockquote> 
					<p>Even though we did not ask about respondents’ experiences with war and <span class="entity keyword" about="trauma" data-label="trauma" data-sort="trauma" data-wikidata-id="Q654426">trauma</span>, they occasionally spoke about their experiences and the potential effects on the children. Similarly, and especially in informal conversations, they articulated worries related to living as a <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span>. The unpredictability of the respondents’ lives became visible in the stress experienced due to asylum procedures, the pressure to earn enough money and worries about children who needed to work to gain an income. Frequently, parents discussed being worried about their children not attending school for several years, and the uncertain prospects this gave their children.</p> 
					<p>Living in a foreign country without knowing the language and culture is associated with challenges, like those described here by <span class="entity person" about="Amena" data-label="Amena" data-sort="Amena">Amena</span>’s mother:</p> 
						<blockquote>Here in <span class="entity place country" about="Turkey" data-label="Turkey" data-sort="Turkey" data-wikidata-id="Q43">Turkey</span> as me myself I can’t, I feel myself that I’m ignorant. Because I don’t know the language of this country. I want my children to learn the language of this country to go out and know how to treat, how to behave, how to talk.</blockquote> 
					<p>A <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> teacher described the situation of being an outsider and the possible consequences for <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span>:</p> 
						<blockquote>I mean, main problem of a <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">child</span> is that they are not really considered as a person, or their opinions are not that important in society. But for the <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugees</span> it’s double, it’s double disadvantaged. They are <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugees</span>, they don’t know the language, they are most discriminated from the other <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span>, or like the society. So they are kind of shy and blocked and they want to just be invisible. They want to be invisible because of this, they are like really not ready to go in front of the society.</blockquote> 
					<p>Indeed, some timid and withdrawn participants were observed in the classes, although externalizing behaviour was also noted.</p> 
					<p>Overall, <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span> are likely to have several problems. The most obvious problems are the lack of purposeful daytime activities and regular school attendance. Several participants felt bored or alone, and some hung around in the streets and <q>made problems</q>. The <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugees</span> faced language problems and, in some cases, discrimination. Past experiences in the country of origin and stress factors in the new country may also influence their present life. Consequently, <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> may show withdrawn or externalizing behaviour. In the section below, the influence of <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes on the circumstances of living as a <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> are discussed.</p> 
			<h5>Changes in Energy</h5> 
				<p>The <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes allowed participants to join activities, play and experience enjoyment. <q>Enjoying</q> and <q>having fun</q> were mentioned many times by participants, parents and <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> teachers. Many parents mentioned that their <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> played <q>primary</q> (easy) games at home, or that they were <q>just playing in the streets</q>. They pointed out that the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes offered <q>organized play</q>: playing, participating in new activities and having new experiences in a structured environment. As a <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> teacher, the first author observed that the participants were eager to join new activities and learn new skills. Even relatively easy games involving counting, clapping or simple movements were played enthusiastically. Some parents noticed that their <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> continued practising the newly learned activities at home.</p> 
				<p>After only a few weeks of joining the <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span>, several changes were observed in the <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> by the parents and teachers. Some parents mentioned that their <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> became more active. <span class="entity person" about="Riham" data-label="Riham" data-sort="Riham">Riham</span>’s parent described the following change:</p> 
					<blockquote>Before she was very nervous. Nervous and sad. While she came here, . . . she became more happy, and active. . . . She slept until the afternoon, before. Now she get up early and become active and waiting to come to the circus. That’s changed.</blockquote>
				<p>Similar changes were mentioned by other parents. On days with classes, their <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> woke up early and without parental input, which was very different from the days without <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes or the days they went to school. It was noticed that the majority of participants arrived before the start of the classes. Towards the end of this study, the participants arrived in the early morning to request the training space be opened. At the start of the course, some participants stood along the side; however, after a few weeks, they began to join in spontaneously. Some participants, parents and <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> teachers noticed that participants became less shy, both in the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> and at home.</p> 
				<p>Some parents also explained that attending the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes allowed their <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> to expend their energy, instead of <q>wandering on the streets</q> or <q>making a lot of troubles at home</q>. <span class="entity person" about="Mahmoud" data-label="Mahmoud" data-sort="Mahmoud">Mahmoud</span> had participated in the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> for a long time and he described not only how the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> had changed his behaviour, but how, having become a teacher in the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> himself, he has observed similar changes in other <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span>:</p> 
					<blockquote>I believe that <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> is changing the behaviours of <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> and young people, because I observing that the kids, or young people outside, who is behaving very bad, fighting and hitting us. When they are coming to <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> and I saw that how they are changing with the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> training. And I want to do this, because I don’t want that the <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> or young people be loser in the street. And to gain them in the life, like to create and do something, stay on their feet and with these things you know, giving them a purpose.</blockquote> 
				<p>An enormous amount of energy was found to be present in the participant groups, especially in those who did not attend school. Research notes taken on <time>6 April 2016</time> state:</p> 
					<blockquote>So much energy in this group. . . . They seem to have some kind of basic respect for me now, which makes it possible to use their energy in a more controlled way. It’s still possible to correct them, and they accept the limits I set.</blockquote> 
				<p>When the first author began teaching the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes, an uncontrolled outburst of energy was observed in the participants. Methods of successfully channelling this energy into <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> activities were developed and behavioural changes were observed. In the beginning, participants showed relatively impulsive behaviours, such as overreacting in interactions with peers, handling materials carelessly and impulsively changing between different disciplines. This behaviour was mostly visible in participants who did not attend school and for whom the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes were their only structured activities. After a while, their behaviour became more controlled; for example, the participants learned to wait their turn, to focus on one activity for an extended period and they started to arrange materials instead of just throwing them on the floor. Interactions became less <q>explosive</q>. In general, the behaviour of participants seemed to develop from relatively uncontrolled to more controlled and some previously shy, passive and withdrawn participants started to express themselves spontaneously and become more active. Taken together, we found that the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes caused participants to become more active, while at the same time allowing them to expend their energy.</p> 
			<h5>Safety and Social Interaction</h5> 
				<p>Respondents described the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> atmosphere generally in terms such as <q>love</q>, <q>safety</q>, <q>freedom</q> and <q>as a family</q>. Teachers and peers were often mentioned in explanations of this atmosphere. Participants and parents frequently described the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> teachers as <q>polite and friendly</q>, <q>seem to be as mothers</q>, <q>taking care</q> and <q>teaching with love</q>. Teachers confirmed that building a relationship with participants was an important aspect of teaching <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes.</p> 
				<p>Participants described the teachers’ support in their learning of the new skills as follows: <q>If there is anything difficult, the teacher let it become easy</q> and <q>I feel safety, because they always help me</q>. One of the teachers described the importance of creating a safe environment (in this case, in the context of learning to walk on wooden stilts) as follows:</p> 
					<blockquote>You just explain it and just you give them a first hand, so like you see how they need to trust. Like they hold your hand like crazy and they want to trust and if they are there to give your first trust, like they are really trusting you little bit, but not that much. After they feel more like, the things that you say it’s working okay make like this, make like this, ah they start to really trust you more and more.</blockquote> 
				<p>Similar situations were experienced by the first author acting as a teacher. Sometimes participants did not dare to do a trick but, after physical or mental support from a teacher, they managed to do it. The next time they needed support, they quickly accepted the same teacher’s help and showed trust. Similarly, a teacher described how participants also helped each other to put on their stilts and support each other while walking:</p> 
					<blockquote>I see in many students also, in the stilts. They trust in each other: <q>ah come help me, will you come help me? Come help me to put my stilts, give me your hand</q>.</blockquote> 
				<p>Topics such as <q>supporting each other</q> and <q>being a group</q> were frequently mentioned in the interviews and many participants concluded that they made friends in the circus. Participants emphasized the importance of learning together. They stated that they felt supported by others and described that they were motivated to support others while learning: <q>I want my friend to learn also, not just me.</q></p> 
				<p>A few respondents explicitly mentioned that this non-competitive aspect, learning together instead of competing, is important in the circus. <span class="entity person" about="Mahmoud" data-label="Mahmoud" data-sort="Mahmoud">Mahmoud</span>, on the other hand, believed competition between friends could also be important in a supportive group:</p> 
					<blockquote>It’s like a competition, because I get to know many friends like me that making acrobatics and things. And I was chatting with one of my friends that, what can you, like, things that you are doing, like backflip or this. I said no I am not able to make backflip. . . . And I start to practice. . . . maybe it was like getting a purpose and working very hardly.</blockquote> 
				<p>It seems that, one way or another, participants motivated each other to improve themselves, in many cases by being a role model for one another. By observing others performing tricks, they gained trust in their capacities and learned that they could improve their capabilities by simply persevering. In addition, they learned to trust the teachers and their peers. This seems to result from both the physical and balancing <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> activities, which can be learned by perseverance and practising, but for which the (physical) support of and trust in others are also needed. The teachers nurtured an atmosphere of safety, <q>being part of a family</q> and encouragement without pressure.</p> 
			<h5>Progress and Performances</h5> 
				<p>The circus-class training led to visible results. The participants learned to control juggling balls and their bodies while doing tricks, making them feel competent. Some respondents mentioned that it felt like they had a talent and that they could do something special that other people could not do. Research notes taken on <time>28 February 2016</time> state:</p> 
					<blockquote>The <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> seem to be surprised about what they’re doing. First looking to themselves, then (realising that they’re actually doing the trick?) looking around, smiling and making eye contact with other people in the room. They start shining even more when an applause follows or a high five is given.</blockquote> 
				<p>This extract was written with regard to participants learning how to walk on a large plastic ball. After some practice, their walking improved step by step and, once they managed to walk by themselves, they looked around and smiled at other people in the room. This process happened a lot during the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes: participants gradually gained self-confidence and pride, and learned that, through perseverance, they could learn things they previously thought were unachievable.</p> 
				<p>Throughout this process, watching performances, which are part of the performing arts, appeared to be important inspiration and motivation for the participants. <span class="entity person" about="Mahmoud" data-label="Mahmoud" data-sort="Mahmoud">Mahmoud</span> described his first experience with the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> as follows:</p> 
					<blockquote>At the first time when they made a show in our school, it was an amazing show for us. That they were making very great tricks, which is very impressing. And I was like (...) that I want to learn to do it, because it was really impressing, the people when they were making this. And I was dreaming during the show that I don’t know how to go there and I want to join them.</blockquote> 
				<p>In the interviews with participants, performances were mentioned several times from two perspectives: as the performer and as the spectator. <span class="entity person" about="Mahmoud" data-label="Mahmoud" data-sort="Mahmoud">Mahmoud</span>’s quote above illustrates how watching a <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> appeared to be a source of inspiration. The artists functioned as role models for the <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span> in the audience. Many participants mentioned that they were impressed after they saw a show and became motivated to be like the artists.</p> 
				<p>Almost directly after the participants began classes, they started to explore the performer’s perspective while showing their skills to others. Participants noticed how showing off their achieved skills made them feel proud and happy, and how they were encouraged by the spectators when in the role of a performer. To perform a <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> act seemed to be associated with having the identity of an artist, as <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> teacher <span class="entity person" about="Ayla" data-label="Ayla" data-sort="Ayla">Ayla</span> described:</p> 
					<blockquote>Since you start to learn something that you are proud, and everybody is not looking that you are <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span>, you are an artist, you are doing something on stage, they really appreciate it. And with our groups of people, nobody knows if they are Syrian, Iraqi, Mardinian. Doesn’t matter, they are on stage, doing something amazing and everybody want to make a picture with them.</blockquote> 
			<h5>Future Perspectives</h5> 
				<p>Besides <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes, the participants attended Turkish-language classes. The participants and their parents agreed that it is crucial to learn the language of the country you live in to be able to communicate with others and participate in society. Some parents also mentioned the importance of studying other subjects, such as mathematics, to build a better future. The participants appeared to be motivated to learn whatever was taught. Several participants mentioned that they <q>want to learn everything</q> and <q>want to learn as much as possible</q>.</p> 
				<p>Virtually all respondents stressed the importance of <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes. This was surprising, as it had been expected that the participants would predominantly consider language classes the most important. The participants emphasized that the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes had an irreplaceable role in the project, even though they could not exactly describe why. Some differences between the language and <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes were mentioned. <span class="entity person" about="Aliya" data-label="Aliya" data-sort="Aliya">Aliya</span> described the following difference:</p> 
					<blockquote>I like both school, because I’m learning there, like become something, like become a doctor, or a teacher. But here [in the circus] also I’m learning something, very excited things, to like, in my dream. And I’m learning also this, and both is important.</blockquote> 
				<p><span class="entity person" about="Aliya" data-label="Aliya" data-sort="Aliya">Aliya</span> described the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes as a place to learn <q>exciting things</q>, of which she could only dream. Many participants mentioned that they were excited about the circus, whereas this description was not used when talking about school or learning languages. One participant explained that he was internally motivated to learn <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> arts, in contrast to learning languages, which he felt were necessary to learn.</p> 
				<p>The parents and participants also mentioned the importance of having new experiences, meeting people from different countries, discovering new things and becoming more open-minded. For some participants, the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> created a new future perspective in a direct way, as <span class="entity person" about="Kasim" data-label="Kasim" data-sort="Kasim">Kasim</span> said:</p> 
					<blockquote>Actually the circus, it’s the best. . . . Because for me it’s the best, I like the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> too much, yes. This is my, when I become to, like about thirty years old, I will be juggler, nothing else.</blockquote> 
				<p>One parent said that the course gave them hope that <q>there is something good waiting</q> for their <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span>. Similarly, the participants pointed out that they dreamed of showing off their skills, giving performances and being famous. <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">Circus</span> classes and performing acts were therefore inspiring, and sometimes even created clear future ambitions.</p>

		<h3>Discussion and Conclusion</h3> 
			<p>It was expected that <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> activities would enhance resilience in <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span> by promoting <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span>, <span class="entity keyword" about="interpersonal trust" data-label="interpersonal trust" data-sort="interpersonal trust">interpersonal trust</span> and social support. Here, the results of the interviews and observations are discussed, as well as the limitations of the study. Recommendations are given for future research, and implications for practice are shared.</p>
			<h5>Self-esteem</h5> 
				<p>Practising <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> tricks led to visible progress in the participants, giving them a feeling of competence. The participants felt talented and able to do something special. Previous research suggests a relationship between the mastery of new skills and self-confidence (<a class="bib_note" id="ref91_3.1" href="#bib10_3.1">Copeland et al. 2012</a>); therefore, learning new <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> skills may indeed increase <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span>. Furthermore, training and learning in a group may accelerate the learning process because the participants felt motivated to try new tricks and movements when they saw others doing the same thing. They encouraged each other verbally and non-verbally, which also increased <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span>. In addition, the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> skills required lead to an increased control over and trust in their bodies, enhancing <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span>.</p> 
				<p>A crucial finding is the importance of performances of <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> activities for the participants. Performances and presentations, whether big or small, gave participants a chance to show off their newly acquired skills. The participants were proud to perform and felt encouraged by the audience. Moreover, the performances allowed the participants to perceive themselves as admired <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> artists. For <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span>, this revered position is in contrast to their daily experience of being viewed only as a <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span>. Experiencing success and being in the valued position of an artist may reinforce <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> youngsters’ <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span> and give them hope for the future, especially in their daily context of experiencing language problems, discrimination and uncertain prospects. These findings are similar to those of Bessone <a class="bib_note" id="ref92_3.1" href="#bib5_3.1">(2017)</a> and Spiegel and Parent <a class="bib_note" id="ref93_3.1" href="#bib50_3.1">(2017)</a>, who described an increase in <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span> and self-discipline, as well as more positive views of oneself, in a community of marginalized <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span> engaging in <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> programmes.</p> 
			<h5>Interpersonal Trust</h5> 
				<p>Human rights violations and traumatic events may lead to a lack of <span class="entity keyword" about="interpersonal trust" data-label="interpersonal trust" data-sort="interpersonal trust">interpersonal trust</span> (<a class="bib_note" id="ref94_3.1" href="#bib52_3.1">Strauser et al. 2006</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref95_3.1" href="#bib38_3.1">Nickerson et al. 2014</a>), whereas the perceived support and sense of security offered by teachers are associated with post-traumatic growth (<a class="bib_note" id="ref96_3.1" href="#bib62_3.1">Yu et al. 2010</a>). In the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes, participants and teachers developed a trusting relationship because participants needed to and could rely on the teachers and each other for support, both mentally and physically. The friendly attitudes of the teachers appeared to contribute to this sense of safety. The participants stated that, as well as feeling safe in the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> school, they increasingly trusted their teachers and each other. The physical support that teachers and participants offer each other while learning new tricks seemed to reinforce this relationship.</p> 
				<p>The observed increases in <span class="entity keyword" about="interpersonal trust" data-label="interpersonal trust" data-sort="interpersonal trust">interpersonal trust</span> may be a result of the mechanisms relatively specific to learning <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> disciplines, because of their physical and often risky characteristics (<a class="bib_note" id="ref97_3.1" href="#bib5_3.1">Bessone 2017</a>). Spiegel et al. (<a class="bib_note" id="ref98_3.1" href="#bib51_3.1">2019</a>) found that the pre-post effects of parkour and capoeira on personal growth and social inclusion, measured through retrospective surveys, were similar to those of <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes. Meanwhile, potentially less physically risky activities in comparative programmes (e.g. personal defence, dance, music, art and language studies) showed smaller effects. Mason (<a class="bib_note" id="ref99_3.1" href="#bib29_3.1">2014</a>) mentioned that <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> participating in <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> in a warzone in <span class="entity place country" about="Afghanistan" data-label="Afghanistan" data-sort="Afghanistan" data-wikidata-id="Q889">Afghanistan</span> showed an increase in eye contact, more open body postures and more physical closeness, indicating increased trust.</p> 
			<h5>Social Support</h5> 
				<p>Social isolation is identified as a risk factor for the development of sustained mental health problems (<a class="bib_note" id="ref100_3.1" href="#bib27_3.1">Lustig et al. 2004</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref101_3.1" href="#bib14_3.1">Ehntholt and Yule 2006</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref102_3.1" href="#bib11_3.1">Daud et al. 2008</a>). The participants in the present study spoke of the importance of being part of a group, making friends and supporting each other during <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes. Social isolation appeared to be successfully reduced in the <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> classes because of the opportunities for social interaction and building relationships (cf. <a class="bib_note" id="ref103_3.1" href="#bib32_3.1">McCauley 2011</a>). Social interaction may lead to social support, depending on the frequency and quality of the social interactions (<a class="bib_note" id="ref104_3.1" href="#bib49_3.1">Shinn et al. 1984</a>). In learning and performing <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> acts, the participants have specific interactions in which they require the physical and mental support of others while also receiving respect and encouragement (cf. <a class="bib_note" id="ref105_3.1" href="#bib5_3.1">Bessone 2017</a>). <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> may also indirectly promote social support by increasing <span class="entity keyword" about="interpersonal trust" data-label="interpersonal trust" data-sort="interpersonal trust">interpersonal trust</span> (<a class="bib_note" id="ref106_3.1" href="#bib21_3.1">Hamid and Lok 2000</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref107_3.1" href="#bib47_3.1">Rotenberg et al. 2004</a>) and <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span> (<a class="bib_note" id="ref108_3.1" href="#bib28_3.1">Marshall et al. 2014</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref109_3.1" href="#bib50_3.1">Spiegel and Parent 2017</a>). Our results are in line with findings from previous studies that identify greater social interactions and engagement with others (<a class="bib_note" id="ref110_3.1" href="#bib24_3.1">Kinunnen et al. 2013</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref111_3.1" href="#bib50_3.1">Spiegel and Parent 2017</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref112_3.1" href="#bib51_3.1">Spiegel et al. 2019</a>) and decreased loneliness and feelings of isolation (<a class="bib_note" id="ref113_3.1" href="#bib3_3.1">Bassel 2005</a>) due to <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> activities.</p> 
			<h5>Activity Levels</h5> 
				<p>The participants stated that, before they joined the circus, they felt bored or alone, and had few daytime activities. Some participants showed withdrawn behaviours. Others, especially participants who did not attend school, had lots of energy and displayed uncontrolled behaviour. According to the literature, <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> may develop maladaptive psycho-social behaviours in situations of conflict or social unrest (<a class="bib_note" id="ref114_3.1" href="#bib30_3.1">McAdam-Crisp 2006</a>). Similarly, <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> with PTSD, which several participants may have suffered from, regularly show hypo- or hyper-active behaviour (<a class="bib_note" id="ref115_3.1" href="#bib15_3.1">Falasca and Caulfield 1999</a>). Although such behaviour might have been adaptive in previous, dangerous environments, it can hinder adjustment to new and safer living situations (<a class="bib_note" id="ref116_3.1" href="#bib27_3.1">Lustig et al. 2004</a>).</p> 
				<p>The <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> activities functioned as daytime activities and provided daily structure. The classes provided a reason to get out of bed in the mornings and prevented youngsters from misbehaving in the streets. The participants became more active but were also able to expend their energy in a controlled and safe environment. Similarly, after just two weeks of <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> training, <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> in a warzone in <span class="entity place country" about="Afghanistan" data-label="Afghanistan" data-sort="Afghanistan" data-wikidata-id="Q889">Afghanistan</span> showed less chaotic behaviour; fewer interruptions; increased focus, concentration and attentiveness; and better learning (<a class="bib_note" id="ref117_3.1" href="#bib29_3.1">Mason 2014</a>). A study among Palestinian <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> showed a decrease in the internalization and externalization of problems after participating in structured activities such as dancing, art classes and sports (<a class="bib_note" id="ref118_3.1" href="#bib26_3.1">Loughry et al. 2006</a>). The behavioural changes identified in the present study may therefore not be specific to <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> activities, although the physical exertion may be relevant.</p> 
				<p>By discovering new things and experiencing them with perseverance, it is possible to learn new and exciting skills. The <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> activities may therefore improve the participants’ perspectives of the future. For some participants, dreaming about a future as a <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> artist created new ambitions to strive for. An increased sense of purpose in life was also found for <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> participants by Spiegel and Parent (<a class="bib_note" id="ref119_3.1" href="#bib50_3.1">2017</a>) and has been identified as a strong predictor of subjective wellbeing (<a class="bib_note" id="ref120_3.1" href="#bib53_3.1">Taylor 2015</a>). Moreover, the importance of creating new projects and structure in life is stressed in research regarding the mental health needs of <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> communities (<a class="bib_note" id="ref121_3.1" href="#bib35_3.1">Miller and Rasco 2004</a>). By creating a purpose in life, in both the short term and long term, <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> may therefore contribute to the wellbeing and mental health of <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span>.</p> 
			<h5>Limitations and Recommendations</h5> 
				<p>This study shows the promising effects of <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> activities for <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span>; however, this research has some limitations. First, the first author was in the position of both a researcher and a voluntary <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> teacher during her stay in <span class="entity place city" about="Mardin" data-label="Mardin" data-sort="Mardin" data-wikidata-id="Q188022">Mardin</span>. This participative research design has both advantages and disadvantages. The participants and their parents occasionally wanted to express their gratitude to the first author as a representative of the project. As a result, the respondents may have mentioned the positive aspects of the project so as not to appear ungrateful. On the other hand, building rapport is important for gaining information (<a class="bib_note" id="ref122_3.1" href="#bib43_3.1">Patton 2002</a>) and being a teacher presented opportunities to gain the trust of the participants before the interviews were conducted, providing authentic access to <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> communities (<a class="bib_note" id="ref123_3.1" href="#bib34_3.1">Miller 2004</a>). In addition, the first author had the opportunity to observe participants without changing their behaviour as an outsider.</p> 
				<p>Working with non-professional interpreters also had advantages and disadvantages. Without doubt, information was lost or changed in the imperfect English translations in both directions. Moreover, not speaking the participant’s language made it impossible to obtain information from daily conversations. Finally, both interpreters were also involved in the project, which could have biased their translations of the questions and the respondents’ answers. On the other hand, the participants already knew both interpreters, and all the interviewed mothers seemed to trust them and seemed comfortable in their presence. Some of the mothers even continued talking with the interpreter after the interview. Again, the importance of trust, necessary for data collection, was clearly visible here (<a class="bib_note" id="ref124_3.1" href="#bib34_3.1">Miller 2004</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref125_3.1" href="#bib43_3.1">Patton 2002</a>).</p> 
				<p>Initially, we aimed to include quantitative measures, using questionnaires measuring <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span>, <span class="entity keyword" about="interpersonal trust" data-label="interpersonal trust" data-sort="interpersonal trust">interpersonal trust</span> and social support; however, the pre-test and post-test data obtained was not sufficiently reliable for such analyses. The main reason for this was that the language barrier was too significant. Although the questionnaires were translated into Arabic, several participants could not read or understand the Modern Standard Arabic used in the questionnaires. To overcome these language problems, an interpreter read the questions for all participants. Unfortunately, this led to the sharing of answers between participants, which likely influenced their answers. Second, the period between the pre-test and post-test analysis was short. Additionally, the pre-test questionnaire was taken a few weeks after the programme had started, rather than taking place before the start, as had initially been intended. Finally, we lacked the means (e.g. comparison groups) of gaining insights into the differences between <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> activities and other interventions.</p> 
				<p>In future studies, we advise that quantitative data is acquired individually and verbally. In this way, most problems associated with the reading and interpreting of questions can be avoided, and answers will not be influenced by other respondents (although they may still be influenced by the researcher). Concerning qualitative data collection, it would be beneficial if researchers spoke the same language as the respondents to avoid information being lost in translation, and so that informal conversations and focus group interviews could be included in data collection.</p> 
				<p>Although we found clear indications that <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> activities may positively affect the wellbeing of <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span>, this study does not yield robust evidence of increased resilience. Only tentative conclusions can be drawn on the possible transfer of circus-class effects to daily life or the longer-term effects on mental health. Longitudinal research integrating qualitative and quantitative data collection is therefore recommended (<a class="bib_note" id="ref126_3.1" href="#bib61_3.1">Weine et al. 2014</a>). Good examples of such data-collection approaches are the studies by Spiegel and Parent (<a class="bib_note" id="ref127_3.1" href="#bib50_3.1">2017</a>) in <span class="entity place region" about="Quebec" data-label="Quebec" data-sort="Quebec" data-wikidata-id="Q176">Quebec</span> and by Spiegel et al. (<a class="bib_note" id="ref128_3.1" href="#bib51_3.1">2019</a>) in <span class="entity place country" about="Ecuador" data-label="Ecuador" data-sort="Ecuador" data-wikidata-id="Q736">Ecuador</span>, in which qualitative methods (observation, focus groups, interviews and more) are combined with the quantitative results from retrospective prepost surveys. Specifically, prospective pre-post data may be collected in future studies to prevent memory bias. The comparison of different activities can also be informative with regard to the specific effects of <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> and other (arts) interventions (cf. <a class="bib_note" id="ref129_3.1" href="#bib51_3.1">Spiegel et al. 2019</a>). Studies may also consider the broader community effects, while remaining sensitive to the critical discussions of the aims and effects of social programmes (<a class="bib_note" id="ref130_3.1" href="#bib5_3.1">Bessone 2017</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref131_3.1" href="#bib51_3.1">Spiegel et al. 2019</a>).</p> 
			<h5>Implications for Practice</h5> 
				<p>Based on our results, we suggest some approaches for improving the practice of <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> activities for <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span> <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span> and activities for <span class="entity keyword" about="vulnerable youth" data-label="vulnerable youth" data-sort="vulnerable youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">vulnerable <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span></span> in general. First, the participants and parents emphasized the importance of a safe environment and a warm relationship with the teachers. By taking care of the participants, showing love and respect, and continuously showing them that they can be trusted, teachers play a crucial role in creating a safe environment. Teacher support may enhance participants’ feelings of safety and trust. Support can be offered both verbally and non-verbally in social interactions, and also by physically assisting youngsters while learning something challenging or risky. When teachers are successful in this, they can become role models, foster similar behaviour among participants and ideally create a sense of being part of a family (cf. <a class="bib_note" id="ref132_3.1" href="#bib7_3.1">Bolton 2004</a>; <a class="bib_note" id="ref133_3.1" href="#bib5_3.1">Bessone 2017</a>). The role of teachers in the success of such projects cannot, therefore, be overestimated.</p> 
				<p>The types of education that <span class="entity keyword" about="youth" data-label="youth" data-sort="youth" data-wikidata-id="Q190007">youth</span> receive may also be important. It appears relevant that <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> is something <q>exciting</q> that <span class="entity keyword" about="child" data-label="child" data-sort="child" data-wikidata-id="Q7569">children</span> may need to work hard to learn, but which results in admiration when it is being mastered through perseverance. In this respect, we had not anticipated the importance that performances seemed to have. Performances allowed participants to feel proud of themselves and seemed to boost their <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span>. Giving and watching <span class="entity keyword" about="circus" data-label="circus" data-sort="circus" data-wikidata-id="Q47928">circus</span> performances appeared to allow young people to dream about the future, to show off their capabilities and to be admired as an artist, giving them <span class="entity keyword" about="self-esteem" data-label="self-esteem" data-sort="self-esteem" data-wikidata-id="Q10981881">self-esteem</span> and a temporary break from their identity as a marginalized and <span class="entity keyword" about="vulnerable refugee" data-label="vulnerable refugee" data-sort="vulnerable refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">vulnerable <span class="entity keyword" about="refugee" data-label="refugee" data-sort="refugee" data-wikidata-id="Q131572">refugee</span></span>. Performances, whether big or small, are thus an indispensable part of the success of <span class="entity keyword" about="Social Circus" data-label="Social Circus" data-sort="Social Circus">Social Circus</span> as an intervention.</p>
